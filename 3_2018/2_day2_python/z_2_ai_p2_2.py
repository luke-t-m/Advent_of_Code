"""To solve this problem, we need to read the input file, count the number of box IDs that contain exactly two of any letter and the number of box IDs that contain exactly three of any letter. We can then multiply these two counts together to get a rudimentary checksum.

First, let's create a function to read the input file and return a list of box IDs:

"""
def read_input():
    with open("2_input", "r") as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f]
"""

Next, let's create a function to count the number of box IDs that contain exactly two of any letter and the number of box IDs that contain exactly three of any letter:

"""
def count_letters(box_ids):
    two_count = 0
    three_count = 0
    for box_id in box_ids:
        # Count the number of times each letter appears in the box ID
        letter_counts = {}
        for letter in box_id:
            if letter not in letter_counts:
                letter_counts[letter] = 0
            letter_counts[letter] += 1

        # Check if the box ID contains exactly two or three of any letter
        if 2 in letter_counts.values():
            two_count += 1
        if 3 in letter_counts.values():
            three_count += 1

    return two_count, three_count
"""

Finally, let's write the main function that uses the above functions to solve the problem:

"""
def solve():
    # Read the input
    box_ids = read_input()

    # Count the number of box IDs that contain exactly two of any letter and the number of box IDs that contain exactly three of any letter
    two_count, three_count = count_letters(box_ids)

    # Calculate the checksum by multiplying the two counts
    checksum = two_count * three_count

    # Print the answer
    print(checksum)
"""

The full code would be:

"""
def read_input():
    with open("2_input", "r") as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f]

def count_letters(box_ids):
    two_count = 0
