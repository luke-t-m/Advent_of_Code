"""Here's a solution that solves both parts of the problem:

import collections

def count_letters(string):
    counts = collections.Counter(string)
    two_count = sum(1 for letter, count in counts.items() if count == 2)
    three_count = sum(1 for letter, count in counts.items() if count == 3)
    return two_count, three_count

    three_counts = 0

            return ''.join(c1 for c1, c2 in zip(string1, string2) if c1 == c2)

with open('2_input', 'r') as file:
    strings = [line.strip() for line in file]

print(checksum(strings))
print(find_box_ids(strings))
"""

The `checksum` function first counts the number of letters that appear exactly two and three times in each string, and then returns the product of these counts. The `find_box_ids` function finds the two strings that differ by exactly one character at the same position by comparing each pair of strings, and then returns the common characters between these two strings.

To use this solution, save it to a file and run it with python, making sure that the input is saved in a file called `2_input`."""
