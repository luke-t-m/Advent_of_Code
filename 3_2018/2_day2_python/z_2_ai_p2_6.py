"""The solution to this problem involves reading the input from the specified file, `2_input`, processing the input to find the number of box IDs that have exactly two or three of any letter, and then using these counts to compute a checksum. Finally, the solution involves finding the two box IDs that differ by exactly one character and printing the common letters between them. Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the lines into a list
with open('2_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Initialize counters for the number of box IDs with exactly two or three of any letter
two_count = 0
three_count = 0

# Loop through each line in the input
for line in lines:
    # Convert the line to a set to remove duplicate characters
    s = set(line.strip())

    # Initialize flags for whether the current ID has exactly two or three of any letter
    has_two = False
    has_three = False

    # Loop through each character in the set
    for c in s:
        # Count the number of times the character appears in the ID
        count = line.count(c)

        # If the character appears exactly two or three times, set the corresponding flag to True
        if count == 2:
            has_two = True
        elif count == 3:
            has_three = True

    # If the current ID has exactly two of any letter, increment the two_count
    if has_two:
        two_count += 1

    # If the current ID has exactly three of any letter, increment the three_count
    if has_three:
        three_count += 1

# Multiply the two_count and the three_count to compute the checksum
checksum = two_count * three_count

# Print the checksum
print(checksum)


# Loop through each line in the input
for i in range(len(lines)):
    # Loop through each other line in the input
    for j in range(i + 1, len(lines)):
        # Compute the number of different characters between the two IDs
        diff = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(lines[i], lines[j]))

        # If the two IDs differ by exactly one character, print the common letters between them
        if diff == 1:
            common = ''.join(c1 for c1, c2 in zip(lines[i], lines[j]) if c1 == c2)
            print(common)
