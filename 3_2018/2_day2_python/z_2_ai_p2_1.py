"""To solve this problem correctly in Python, you would first need to read the input from the file named "2_input". You can do this by opening the file and reading its contents line by line. Here is an example of how you could do this:

"""
# Open the input file
with open("2_input", "r") as input_file:
    # Read the contents of the input file line by line
    for line in input_file:
        # Process each line of input here
        pass
"""

Once you have read the input, you can use a combination of `if` statements and string manipulation techniques to find the box IDs that contain exactly two or three of any letter. You can then multiply these counts together to get the checksum.

To find the boxes with IDs that differ by exactly one character, you can iterate over the list of box IDs and compare each ID to every other ID in the list. If two IDs differ by only one character, you can then remove that character and print the resulting common letters. Here is an example of how you could do this:

"""
# Open the input file
with open("2_input", "r") as input_file:
    # Create a list to store the box IDs
    box_ids = []
    
    # Read the contents of the input file line by line
    for line in input_file:
        # Add each box ID to the list
        box_ids.append(line.strip())
        
    # Iterate over the list of box IDs
    for id1 in box_ids:
        for id2 in box_ids:
            # Check if the two IDs differ by only one character
            if sum([1 for a, b in zip(id1, id2) if a != b]) == 1:
                # Remove the differing character and print the resulting common letters
                print("".join([a for a, b in zip(id1, id2) if a == b]))
"""

Note that this is just one possible approach to solving this problem, and there may be other ways to do it."""
