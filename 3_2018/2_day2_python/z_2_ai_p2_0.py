"""Here is a solution in Python to this problem:

"""
# Read in the input file
with open("2_input") as f:
    lines = f.read().splitlines()

# Count the number of box IDs that have exactly two or three of any letter
two_count = 0
three_count = 0
for line in lines:
    # Count the number of times each letter appears in the line
    letter_counts = {}
    for letter in line:
        if letter in letter_counts:
            letter_counts[letter] += 1
        else:
            letter_counts[letter] = 1

    # Check if the line has exactly two or three of any letter
    if 2 in letter_counts.values():
        two_count += 1
    if 3 in letter_counts.values():
        three_count += 1

# Calculate the checksum
checksum = two_count * three_count

# Print the result
print(checksum)

# Find the two box IDs that differ by exactly one character at the same position
for i in range(len(lines)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(lines)):
        # Compare the two lines character by character
        diff_count = 0
        for k in range(len(lines[i])):
            if lines[i][k] != lines[j][k]:
                diff_count += 1

        # If the lines differ by exactly one character, print the common letters
        if diff_count == 1:
            common_letters = ""
            for k in range(len(lines[i])):
                if lines[i][k] == lines[j][k]:
                    common_letters += lines[i][k]
            print(common_letters)
"""

To run this code, save it to a file called "2.py" and run it with the command `python 2.py`. The first part of the output will be the checksum, and the second part will be the common letters between the two box IDs that differ by exactly one character."""
