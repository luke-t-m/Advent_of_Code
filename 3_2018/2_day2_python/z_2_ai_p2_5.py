"""Here is a solution to the problem in Python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the lines
with open('2_input', 'r') as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

# Initialize the counts of two and three of any letter
two_count = 0
three_count = 0

# Loop through the lines
for line in lines:
  # Initialize a dictionary to count the occurences of each letter
  counts = {}

  # Loop through each letter in the line
  for letter in line:
    # If the letter is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
    if letter not in counts:
      counts[letter] = 1
    # Otherwise, increment the count for that letter
    else:
      counts[letter] += 1

  # Initialize flags for whether the line contains exactly two or three of any letter
  has_two = False
  has_three = False

  # Loop through the counts in the dictionary
  for count in counts.values():
    # If the count is 2, set the flag to True
    if count == 2:
      has_two = True
    # If the count is 3, set the flag to True
    elif count == 3:
      has_three = True

  # If the line contains exactly two of any letter, increment the two_count
  if has_two:
    two_count += 1
  # If the line contains exactly three of any letter, increment the three_count
  if has_three:
    three_count += 1

# Print the checksum by multiplying the two_count and the three_count
print(two_count * three_count)

# To find the boxes with IDs that differ by exactly one character,
# we need to compare each line with every other line and check
# for differences. We can use the Levenshtein distance to measure
# the differences between strings.

# Import the Levenshtein distance function from the python-Levenshtein library
from Levenshtein import distance

# Loop through each line in the input
for line1 in lines:
  # Loop through every other line in the input
  for line2 in lines:
    # If the lines are the same, skip this iteration
    if line1 == line2:
      continue

    # If the Levenshtein distance between the lines is 1,
    # we have found the two correct box IDs
    if distance(line1, line2) == 1:
      # Print the common letters by removing the differing character
      # from either ID (in this case, we will remove it from line1)
      print(line1.replace(line1[line1 != line2], '', 1))
"""

To run this code, you will need to install the `python-Levenshtein` library. You can do this using pip:

"""
pip install python-Levenshtein
"""

After running this code, the output will be the checksum followed by the common letters in the two correct box IDs."""
