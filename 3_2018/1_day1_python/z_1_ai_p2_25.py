"""To solve this problem, we can keep track of the current frequency and the set of frequencies we have seen so far. We can then iterate through the list of frequency changes, updating the current frequency and adding it to the set of frequencies we have seen. If we ever reach a frequency that we have seen before, we can stop iterating and return that frequency.

Here is one way we could implement this solution in Python:

"""
# Initialize the current frequency and the set of frequencies we have seen
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set([current_frequency])

# Read the list of frequency changes from the input file
with open("1_input") as f:
    frequency_changes = f.readlines()

# Convert the frequency changes from strings to integers
frequency_changes = [int(x) for x in frequency_changes]

# Keep track of whether we have found a duplicate frequency
found_duplicate = False

# Iterate through the frequency changes
while not found_duplicate:
    for change in frequency_changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # Check if we have seen this frequency before
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            # We have found a duplicate frequency, so stop iterating
            found_duplicate = True
            break

        # Add the current frequency to the set of frequencies we have seen
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)

# Print the first duplicate frequency
print(current_frequency)
"""

Note that the above solution assumes that the input is stored in a file called `1_input`, and that each line of the file contains a single frequency change as a string (e.g. `"+6"` or `"-3"`). The solution also assumes that the input is formatted such that each frequency change is on a separate line, and that the input does not contain any extraneous whitespace."""
