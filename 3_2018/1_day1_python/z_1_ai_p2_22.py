"""To solve this problem, we can keep track of the current frequency and the set of all frequencies we've seen so far. We can then iterate over the list of frequency changes, adding each change to the current frequency, and checking if the new frequency is in the set of frequencies we've seen. If it is, we can return that frequency as the answer. If we reach the end of the list without finding a duplicate frequency, we can repeat the process until we find the first duplicate frequency.

Here is one way to implement this solution in Python:

"""
def first_duplicate_frequency(changes):
  seen = set()
  current = 0
  seen.add(current)
  
  while True:
    for change in changes:
      current += change
      if current in seen:
        return current
      seen.add(current)

# read input from the 1_input file
with open("1_input") as f:
  changes = [int(line) for line in f]

# print the answer
print(first_duplicate_frequency(changes))
