"""To solve this problem, we can create a `while` loop that continues until a duplicate frequency is found. We can use a `set` to store the frequencies that have been seen so far. In each iteration of the `while` loop, we can calculate the next frequency by summing the current frequency and the next change, add the resulting frequency to the set, and update the current frequency. Here's an implementation in Python:

"""
# Read the input
with open('1_input') as f:
  changes = [int(x) for x in f]

# Initialize the current frequency and the set of seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = {0}

# Loop until a duplicate frequency is found
while True:
  for change in changes:
    # Calculate the next frequency
    current_frequency += change

    # If the frequency has been seen before, print the answer and stop
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
      print(current_frequency)
      exit()

    # Otherwise, add the frequency to the set of seen frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

Note that this solution assumes that the input is stored in a file called `1_input`, and that the file contains one integer per line representing the changes in frequency."""
