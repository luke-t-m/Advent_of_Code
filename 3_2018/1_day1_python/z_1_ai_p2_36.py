"""The solution to this problem requires reading a list of numbers from a file, summing them, and printing the result. Here is a correct implementation in Python:

"""
with open("1_input") as file:
    numbers = [int(line) for line in file]

print(sum(numbers))
"""

Note that the code above assumes that the input file is called "1_input" and contains one number per line. The code reads the file, parses each line as an integer, and stores the numbers in a list. Finally, it prints the sum of all numbers in the list."""
