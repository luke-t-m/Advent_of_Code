"""Here is a solution to the problem in python:

"""
def first_duplicate_frequency(changes):
  seen = set()
  current_frequency = 0
  for change in changes:
    current_frequency += change
    if current_frequency in seen:
      return current_frequency
    seen.add(current_frequency)

  changes = [int(line.strip()) for line in f]
  print(first_duplicate_frequency(changes))
"""

This solution reads the input from a file called `1_input`, which should contain one frequency change per line. It then parses the input into a list of integers, and passes this list to the `first_duplicate_frequency` function. This function maintains a set of seen frequencies, and iterates over the list of changes. For each change, it updates the current frequency and checks if it is in the set of seen frequencies. If it is, the function returns the current frequency. If the end of the input is reached without finding a duplicate frequency, the function returns `None`. Finally, the solution prints the result of calling `first_duplicate_frequency` with the list of changes."""
