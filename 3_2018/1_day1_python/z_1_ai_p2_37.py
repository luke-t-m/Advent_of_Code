"""To solve this problem, we will first read the input from the file `1_input` into a list of integers. We will then loop through the list of integers, keeping track of the current frequency as we go. We will also keep a set of all the frequencies we have seen so far. If we encounter a frequency that we have seen before, we will print that frequency and stop. Here is one way to implement this in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('1_input') as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the set of frequencies we have seen
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set()

# Loop through the changes, updating the current frequency and checking if it has been seen before
for change in changes:
    current_frequency += change
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        # We have seen this frequency before, so print it and stop
        print(current_frequency)
        break
    else:
        # This is the first time we have seen this frequency, so add it to the set
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

Note that this solution assumes that the input file contains one integer per line, with no other characters or whitespace. The code above will print the first frequency that is reached twice, as required by the problem."""
