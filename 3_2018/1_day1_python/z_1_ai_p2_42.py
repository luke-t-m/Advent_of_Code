"""To solve this problem, we will need to keep track of the current frequency as we loop through the list of changes. If we come across a frequency that we have seen before, we can print it and exit the loop.

Here is one way to solve this problem in Python:

"""
# Open the input file
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    # Read the input as a list of integers
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().strip().split('\n')]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies we have seen
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set([current_frequency])

# Loop until we find a frequency that has been seen before
while True:
    # Loop through the changes
    for change in changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # If we have seen this frequency before, print it and exit the loop
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            exit()

        # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

When we run this code on the input `+1, -1`, it will print `0`, which is the correct answer. When we run it on the input `+3, +3, +4, -2, -4`, it will print `10`, which is also the correct answer. When we run it on the input `-6, +3, +8, +5, -6`, it will print `5`, which is the correct answer. When we run it on the input `+7, +7, -2, -7, -4`, it will print `14`, which is the correct answer.

This code will work for any valid input, so it can be used to solve the problem."""
