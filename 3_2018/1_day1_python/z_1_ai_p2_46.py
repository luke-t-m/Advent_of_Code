"""To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies we have seen so far. We can do this using a `set` in Python. A `set` is like a list, but it only keeps track of unique elements, which is useful for our purposes.

First, we need to read in the input data from the file. We can use the `open` function to open the file, and then read the lines of the file using a `for` loop. We can convert each line of the input data to an integer using the `int` function.

Next, we can initialize the current frequency to 0 and initialize an empty set of seen frequencies. Then, we can loop over the input data and update the current frequency. If the current frequency is already in the set of seen frequencies, we can print the current frequency and exit the loop. If the current frequency is not in the set of seen frequencies, we can add it to the set.

Here is some sample code to solve the problem:

"""
# initialize the current frequency to 0
current_frequency = 0

# initialize the set of seen frequencies to the empty set
seen_frequencies = set()

# open the input file
with open('1_input') as file:
    # loop over the lines of the file
    for line in file:
        # convert the line to an integer
        change = int(line)

        # update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # check if the current frequency is in the set of seen frequencies
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            # if it is, print the current frequency and exit the loop
            print(current_frequency)
            break

        # if it isn't, add it to the set of seen frequencies
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

We can test the code by writing some test input data to a file called `1_input` and running the code. For example, if the input data is:

"""
+1
-2
+3
+1
"""

Then the output should be:

"""
2
"""

This is the expected result, since the first frequency reached twice is 2.

Here is the complete code to solve the problem:

"""
# initialize the current frequency to 0
current_frequency = 0

# initialize the set of seen frequencies to the empty set
seen_frequencies = set()

# open the input file
with open('1_input') as file:
    # loop over the lines of the file
    for line in file:
        # convert the line to an integer
        change = int(line)

        # update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # check if the current frequency is in the set of seen frequencies
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            # if it is, print the current frequency and exit the loop
            print(current_frequency)
            break

        # if it isn't, add it to the set of seen frequencies
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
