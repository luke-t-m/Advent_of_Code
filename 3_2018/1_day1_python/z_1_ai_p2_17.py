"""To solve this problem, we can keep track of the current frequency and a set of previously seen frequencies. We can then iterate over the list of changes, updating the current frequency and checking if it has been seen before. If it has, we can print the current frequency and stop iterating.

Here is one way to implement this solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open("1_input", "r") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().split("\n") if x]

# Initialize the current frequency and the set of previously seen frequencies
current_freq = 0
seen_freqs = set()

# Iterate over the list of changes
for change in changes:
    # Update the current frequency
    current_freq += change
    
    # Check if the current frequency has been seen before
    if current_freq in seen_freqs:
        # If it has, print the current frequency and stop iterating
        print(current_freq)
        break
    else:
        # If it hasn't, add it to the set of previously seen frequencies
        seen_freqs.add(current_freq)
