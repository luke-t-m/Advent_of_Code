"""To solve this problem, we can simply iterate over the list of frequency changes and keep track of the current frequency. If we encounter a frequency that we have already seen, we can simply print it and stop the program. Here is one possible implementation in Python:

"""
# Read the list of frequency changes from the file
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    changes = [int(line.strip()) for line in f]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the set of frequencies we have seen
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = {0}

# Iterate over the list of frequency changes
for change in changes:
    # Update the current frequency
    current_frequency += change

    # If we have already seen this frequency, print it and stop the program
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        print(current_frequency)
        break

    # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

This code should print the first frequency that is reached twice. Note that this solution assumes that the input is stored in a file called `1_input` in the current directory."""
