"""To solve this problem, you can use a `set` to keep track of the current frequencies as you iterate through the input and update the current frequency. When you encounter a frequency that has already been seen before, you can stop iterating and return the first repeated frequency.

Here's an example implementation in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('1_input') as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().split()]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = {0}

# Keep iterating until we find a repeated frequency
while True:
    for change in changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # If the current frequency has been seen before, print it and stop
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            break
        
        # Otherwise, add it to the set of seen frequencies
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
    else:
        # If we didn't break out of the loop, continue
        continue
    break
