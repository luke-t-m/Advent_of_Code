"""The following is a correct solution to the problem in python:

"""
with open("1_input", "r") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.readlines()]

seen_frequencies = set()
current_frequency = 0

while True:
    for change in changes:
        current_frequency += change
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            exit()
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

This solution reads the input from a file named "1_input" in the current directory. The input is expected to be a list of integers, one per line, indicating the changes to the frequency.

The solution keeps track of the current frequency and the set of seen frequencies. For each change in the input list, the solution updates the current frequency and checks if it has been seen before. If it has, the solution prints the current frequency and exits. Otherwise, the solution adds the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies."""
