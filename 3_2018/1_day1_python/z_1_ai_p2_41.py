"""To solve this problem, we can use a while loop to iterate over the input and keep track of the current frequency and a set of previously seen frequencies. We can then add the current frequency change to the current frequency and check if the updated frequency is in the set of previously seen frequencies. If it is, we can print the current frequency and break out of the loop. Here is a possible implementation in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open("1_input") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().split()]

# Initialize the current frequency and the set of seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = {current_frequency}

# Keep iterating until we find a duplicate frequency
while True:
    for change in changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # Check if we've seen this frequency before
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            # We found a duplicate frequency, so print it and stop the loop
            print(current_frequency)
            break

        # Add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
    else:
        # We didn't break out of the loop, so keep iterating
        continue
    break
"""

We can then save this code to a file and run it to get the answer to the problem."""
