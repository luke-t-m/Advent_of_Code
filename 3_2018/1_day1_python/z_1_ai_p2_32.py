"""Here is a correct implementation of the solution in Python:
"""
# Read input from 1_input
with open('1_input') as f:
    changes = [int(line) for line in f]

# Initialize the frequency to 0
frequency = 0

# Keep a set of seen frequencies
seen_frequencies = set()

# While the frequency is not in the set of seen frequencies
while frequency not in seen_frequencies:
    # Add the frequency to the set of seen frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(frequency)

    # Increment the frequency by the next value in the list
    frequency += changes.pop(0)

    # If the list is empty, start over from the beginning
    if not changes:
        changes = [int(line) for line in f]

# Print the first frequency that was seen twice
print(frequency)
"""

This code reads the input from the file `1_input`, which should contain one integer per line representing the changes in frequency. The code then keeps a set of frequencies that have been seen so far, and keeps incrementing the frequency by the next value in the list. If the list is empty, it starts over from the beginning. The first frequency that is seen twice is printed at the end."""
