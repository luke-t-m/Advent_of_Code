"""To solve this problem, you can keep track of the current frequency and the set of previously seen frequencies in a loop. The loop should continue until a frequency is seen twice, at which point you can print the answer and exit the loop. Here's one way to implement this idea in Python:

"""
# initialize the current frequency and the set of previously seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set()

# read the input from the file
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    changes = [int(line.strip()) for line in f]

# keep looping until a frequency is seen twice
while True:
    # loop through each change in the input
    for change in changes:
        # update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change
        
        # check if the current frequency has been seen before
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            # if it has, print the answer and exit the loop
            print(current_frequency)
            break
        
        # if it hasn't been seen, add it to the set of seen frequencies
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
    else:
        # if we didn't find a duplicate frequency, continue the outer loop
        continue
    break
"""

Note that this solution is not optimized for large inputs, since the set of seen frequencies could potentially grow very large. In practice, however, this solution should work well for the input provided in the problem statement."""
