"""To solve this problem, you could use a `while` loop to keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies that have been reached so far. The loop should continue until a frequency is reached twice, at which point you can print the answer and exit the program.

Here is a solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('1_input') as f:
    changes = [int(line.strip()) for line in f]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies that have been reached
current_frequency = 0
reached_frequencies = {current_frequency}

# Keep looping until a frequency is reached twice
while True:
    for change in changes:
        current_frequency += change
        if current_frequency in reached_frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            exit()
        reached_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

You can run this code by saving it to a file (e.g. `1.py`) and running it with the Python interpreter:

"""
python 1.py
"""

This should print the first frequency that is reached twice, which is the answer to the problem."""
