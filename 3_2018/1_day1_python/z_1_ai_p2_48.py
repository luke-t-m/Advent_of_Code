"""To solve this problem, we need to read the frequency changes from the file `1_input`, and then keep track of the current frequency while iterating through the list of changes. We can use a set to keep track of the frequencies that have been seen before, and then return the first frequency that is seen twice. Here is a solution in Python:

"""
# Read the frequency changes from the input file
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().strip().split('\n')]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies that have been seen before
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set([current_frequency])

# Iterate through the frequency changes
i = 0
while True:
    # Update the current frequency
    current_frequency += changes[i]
    
    # If the current frequency has been seen before, return it
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        print(current_frequency)
        break
        
    # Otherwise, add it to the set of seen frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
    
    # Move to the next frequency change
    i = (i + 1) % len(changes)
"""

The output of this code will be the first frequency that is seen twice."""
