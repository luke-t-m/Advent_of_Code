"""First, let's import the `sys` module which will allow us to read input from a file:
"""
import sys
"""
Next, we will use the `open` function to open the file `1_input` in read mode. This will return a `file` object which we will assign to a variable called `input_file`:
"""
input_file = open("1_input", "r")
"""
Next, we will use the `readlines` method of the `file` object to read all the lines of the input file. The `readlines` method will return a list of strings, where each string is a line from the input file. We will assign this list to a variable called `lines`:
"""
lines = input_file.readlines()
"""
Now that we have all the lines from the input file in a list, we can iterate over this list and convert each string to an integer using the `int` function. We will append each integer to a list called `changes`.
"""
changes = []
for line in lines:
    changes.append(int(line))
"""
Next, we will initialize a variable called `current_frequency` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current frequency as we iterate over the `changes` list and make the changes to the current frequency.
"""
current_frequency = 0
"""
Now, we will iterate over the `changes` list and make the necessary changes to the `current_frequency` variable. We will also keep track of the frequencies we have seen so far in a `set` called `seen_frequencies`. If we encounter a frequency that we have seen before, we will break out of the loop and print the frequency.
"""
seen_frequencies = set()
for change in changes:
    current_frequency += change
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        print(current_frequency)
        break
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""
Finally, we will close the input file using the `close` method:
"""
input_file.close()
"""

Here is the complete code:
"""
import sys

input_file = open("1_input", "r")
lines = input_file.readlines()

changes = []
for line in lines:
    changes.append(int(line))

current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set()
for change in changes:
    current_frequency += change
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        print(current_frequency)
        break
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)

input_file.close()
