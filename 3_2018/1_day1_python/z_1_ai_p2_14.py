"""To solve this problem, we will need to do the following:

1. Read in the input from the file `1_input`
2. Parse the input and extract the frequency changes
3. Keep track of the current frequency, starting at 0
4. Loop through the frequency changes and update the current frequency
5. Keep track of all the frequencies we have seen so far, and check if we have seen the current frequency before
6. If we have seen the current frequency before, print it and exit

We can implement this in Python as follows:

"""
# Open the input file and read the frequency changes
with open("1_input") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().strip().split("\n")]

# Start at frequency 0 and keep track of the current and previous frequencies
current_frequency = 0
previous_frequencies = set()

# Loop until we find a repeated frequency
while True:
    for change in changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # Check if we have seen this frequency before
        if current_frequency in previous_frequencies:
            # If we have, print it and exit
            print(current_frequency)
            exit()

        # If we haven't seen this frequency before, add it to the set
        # of previous frequencies
        previous_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

This code will solve the problem as described above. To run it, save it to a file called `solution.py` and run it using `python solution.py`. It should print the first frequency that is reached twice."""
