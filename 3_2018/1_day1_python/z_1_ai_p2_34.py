"""To solve this problem, you will need to keep track of the current frequency and the set of frequencies that have been seen so far.

First, you can use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers. This will be useful for calculating the current frequency based on the list of frequency changes.

Next, you can use a `while` loop to repeatedly apply the frequency changes until a frequency is reached twice. Inside the loop, you can use the `set()` data structure to keep track of the frequencies that have been seen so far.

Here is a possible implementation in Python:

"""
# Read the list of frequency changes from the input file
with open("1_input", "r") as f:
    changes = f.readlines()

# Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
changes = [int(x) for x in changes]

# Calculate the current frequency using the sum of the frequency changes
current_frequency = sum(changes)

# Initialize the set of seen frequencies with the current frequency
seen_frequencies = {current_frequency}

# Keep applying the frequency changes until a frequency is seen twice
while True:
    # Calculate the next frequency by summing the current frequency with the next frequency change
    current_frequency += changes[i]

    # If the current frequency has been seen before, print it and exit the loop
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        print(current_frequency)
        break

    # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)

    # Increment the index of the current frequency change
    i = (i + 1) % len(changes)
"""

After running this code, the output should be the first frequency that is reached twice. You can then submit this answer to the problem."""
