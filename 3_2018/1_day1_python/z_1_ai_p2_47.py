"""To solve this problem, you can use a set to keep track of the frequencies that have been seen. You can then loop over the input, updating the current frequency and adding it to the set. If the current frequency is already in the set, you know that you have found the first frequency that is reached twice, so you can stop the loop and print the answer. Here is some sample code that you can use to solve this problem:

"""
# read the input
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    data = f.readlines()

# convert the input to a list of integers
data = [int(x) for x in data]

# keep track of the frequencies that have been seen
seen = set()

# start at frequency 0
freq = 0

# loop until we find a duplicate frequency
for change in data:
    freq += change
    if freq in seen:
        # we found a duplicate, so print the answer and stop the loop
        print(freq)
        break
    # add the current frequency to the set of frequencies that have been seen
    seen.add(freq)
"""

You can save this code to a file called `1_solution.py` and run it using `python 1_solution.py` to solve the problem. The output will be the first frequency that is reached twice."""
