"""To solve this problem, we need to read the input from the file "1_input", then sum the numbers in the input to find the first frequency the device reaches twice.

Here is one way to do this in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open("1_input") as file:
    changes = [int(line.strip()) for line in file]

# Sum the numbers in the input to find the first frequency reached twice
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = {0}

while True:
    for change in changes:
        current_frequency += change
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            # We have found the first frequency reached twice
            print(current_frequency)
            break
        seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
    else:
        # If we didn't break out of the loop, the loop finished without finding a duplicate
        # So we repeat the loop with the updated current_frequency and seen_frequencies
        continue
    break
"""

This code reads the input from the file, sums the numbers in the input to find the first frequency reached twice, and prints the answer. Note that this code assumes that the input is in the correct format, as specified in the problem statement.

The answer to this problem is a specific number, so we can't provide the exact answer here. To get the correct answer, you should run the code on your computer using the provided input file."""
