"""To solve this problem, you need to read the frequency changes from the file `1_input`, sum them and find the first frequency that is reached twice. Here is one way to do that in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('1_input') as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.readlines()]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies reached so far
current_frequency = 0
reached_frequencies = {0}

# Loop until a frequency is reached twice
while True:
    for change in changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change

        # If the current frequency has already been reached, print it and stop the loop
        if current_frequency in reached_frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            break
        
        # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of reached frequencies
        reached_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
    else:
        # If the for loop didn't break, continue the while loop
        continue
    break
"""

Note that the above solution uses a set to keep track of the frequencies reached so far. This makes it easy to check whether a frequency has already been reached, since checking if an element is in a set is very fast."""
