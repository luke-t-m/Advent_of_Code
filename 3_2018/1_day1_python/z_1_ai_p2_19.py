"""To solve this problem, we need to find the first frequency that is reached twice by the device. To do this, we can use a `set` to store the visited frequencies and a `while` loop to keep track of the current frequency. We can then apply each frequency change in the input, and check if the current frequency has been seen before by checking if it is in the set of visited frequencies. If it has, we can return the current frequency, since this is the first frequency that is reached twice. If we reach the end of the input without finding a duplicate frequency, we can simply continue looping and applying the frequency changes until we find a duplicate.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file "1_input"
with open("1_input") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f]

# Start at frequency 0
frequency = 0

# Keep track of the visited frequencies in a set
visited = set()

# Keep looping until we find a duplicate frequency
while True:
    for change in changes:
        # Apply the frequency change
        frequency += change

        # Check if we have seen this frequency before
        if frequency in visited:
            # If we have, print the result and exit
            print(frequency)
            exit()

        # Otherwise, add the frequency to the set of visited frequencies
        visited.add(frequency)
"""

We can then run this code and it will print the first frequency reached twice by the device."""
