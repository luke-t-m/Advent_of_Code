"""Here is a correct solution to the problem in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file '1_input'
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    changes = f.readlines()

# Convert the input to a list of integers
changes = [int(x) for x in changes]

# Sum the list of integers to find the resulting frequency
resulting_frequency = sum(changes)

# Print the resulting frequency
print(resulting_frequency)
"""

To run the code, save it in a file called `1.py` and run it with the command `python 1.py`. This will print the resulting frequency to the console."""
