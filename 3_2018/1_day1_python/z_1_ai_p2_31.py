"""The problem can be solved by iterating over the frequency changes, adding each to the current frequency, and storing the current frequency in a set. If the current frequency is already in the set, we can return it as the answer.

Here is a possible implementation in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file "1_input".
with open("1_input") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().strip().split("\n")]

# Initialize the current frequency and the set of seen frequencies.
frequency = 0
seen = set()

# Iterate over the frequency changes.
for change in changes:
    # Update the current frequency.
    frequency += change

    # If the current frequency is already in the set of seen frequencies, return it.
    if frequency in seen:
        print(frequency)
        break

    # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies.
    seen.add(frequency)
"""

This solution should work for any input that follows the given format."""
