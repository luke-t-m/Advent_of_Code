"""To solve this problem, we can keep track of the current frequency and update it by iterating through the list of frequency changes. We can use a `set` to keep track of the frequencies that we've already seen. If we reach a frequency that we've already seen, we can return that frequency.

Here is one possible solution in Python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the list of frequency changes
with open("1_input", "r") as f:
    changes = f.read().strip().split("\n")

# Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
changes = [int(change) for change in changes]

# Set the initial frequency to 0 and create an empty set of frequencies
current_frequency = 0
frequencies = set()

# Keep looping until we find a duplicate frequency
while True:
    # Iterate through the list of frequency changes
    for change in changes:
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change
        
        # If the current frequency is already in the set of frequencies,
        # return it
        if current_frequency in frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            exit()
        
        # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of frequencies
        else:
            frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

To use this solution, save it to a file called `solution.py` and run it using `python solution.py`. The output will be the first frequency that the device reaches twice."""
