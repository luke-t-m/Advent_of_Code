"""To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the current frequency and update it every time we encounter a change in frequency. We can do this by using a variable called `current_frequency` and initializing it to 0. Then, we can read the input from the file `1_input` line by line and update `current_frequency` accordingly. We can use a `set` to keep track of the frequencies we've seen so far. If we encounter a frequency that we've already seen, we can print the answer and stop the program.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Initialize the current frequency and the set of seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set()

# Open the input file
with open("1_input") as file:
    # Iterate over the lines in the file
    for line in file:
        # Convert the line to an integer
        change = int(line)
        # Update the current frequency
        current_frequency += change
        # If we've seen the current frequency before, print the answer and stop the program
        if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
            print(current_frequency)
            break
        # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies
        else:
            seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
