"""To solve this problem, we can keep track of the current frequency and the set of previously seen frequencies. We can then read the frequency changes from the input file and update the current frequency by adding each change to it. If the updated current frequency is already in the set of previously seen frequencies, we can print the current frequency and stop, since this is the first frequency that is reached twice.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the frequency changes from the input file
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    changes = [int(line) for line in f]

# Set the initial frequency and the set of previously seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set([current_frequency])

# Loop over the frequency changes
for change in changes:
    # Update the current frequency
    current_frequency += change

    # If the updated current frequency is already in the set of
    # previously seen frequencies, print it and stop
    if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
        print(current_frequency)
        break

    # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of previously seen
    # frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

This solution will read the frequency changes from the input file, update the current frequency by adding each change to it, and check if the updated current frequency is already in the set of previously seen frequencies. If it is, it will print the current frequency and stop, since this is the first frequency that is reached twice. Otherwise, it will add the current frequency to the set of previously seen frequencies and continue to the next frequency change."""
