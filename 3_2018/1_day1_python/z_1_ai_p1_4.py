"""The solution for this problem is to simply add all of the given frequency changes together. This can be done in python using the `sum()` function. Here is one way to solve this problem using python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the frequency changes
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    frequency_changes = [int(x) for x in f.readlines()]

# Calculate the resulting frequency by summing the frequency changes
resulting_frequency = sum(frequency_changes)

# Print the resulting frequency
print(resulting_frequency)
"""

This code first opens the input file and reads the frequency changes into a list. Then it calculates the resulting frequency by summing the list of frequency changes using the `sum()` function. Finally, it prints the resulting frequency."""
