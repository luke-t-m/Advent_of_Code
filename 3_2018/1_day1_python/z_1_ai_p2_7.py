"""To solve this problem, we need to read the frequency changes from the input file and keep track of the current frequency as we process each change. If we come across a frequency that we have seen before, we can stop and print the first frequency that is reached twice. Here is one way to do this in Python:

"""
# Read the frequency changes from the input file
with open('1_input') as f:
  changes = [int(line.strip()) for line in f]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the frequencies we have seen
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set()

# Process the frequency changes one at a time
for change in changes:
  # Update the current frequency
  current_frequency += change

  # If we have seen the current frequency before, print it and stop
  if current_frequency in seen_frequencies:
    print(current_frequency)
    break

  # Otherwise, add the current frequency to the set of frequencies we have seen
  seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)
"""

This code reads the frequency changes from the input file, processes each change one at a time, and prints the first frequency that is reached twice. You can then use this code to find the answer to the problem."""
