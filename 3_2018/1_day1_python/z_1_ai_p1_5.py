"""The code for solving this problem in Python is as follows:

"""
# read the input from the file
with open('1_input', 'r') as f:
    changes = f.read().strip().split('\n')

# convert the input strings to integers
changes = [int(x) for x in changes]

# compute the result
result = sum(changes)

# print the result
print(result)
"""

To solve this problem, we first read the input from the file `1_input`, which contains a list of frequency changes separated by newline characters. We then convert the input strings to integers using the `int()` function and store them in a list called `changes`.

Next, we use the `sum()` function to compute the sum of the elements in the `changes` list, which gives us the resulting frequency after all of the changes have been applied. Finally, we print the resulting frequency using the `print()` function.

This code should produce the correct answer for the problem and print it to the screen."""
