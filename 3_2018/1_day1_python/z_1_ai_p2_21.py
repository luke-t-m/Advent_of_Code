"""The code to solve this problem is as follows:

"""python
# Read the input file as a list of integers
with open("1_input") as f:
    changes = [int(x) for x in f.read().split()]

# Keep track of the current frequency and the seen frequencies
current_frequency = 0
seen_frequencies = set()

# Loop until we reach a frequency that has been seen before
while current_frequency not in seen_frequencies:
    # Add the current frequency to the set of seen frequencies
    seen_frequencies.add(current_frequency)

    # Update the current frequency by adding the next change in the list
    current_frequency += changes[0]

    # Remove the first element in the list of changes and append it to the end
    # This simulates the list of changes repeating over and over
    changes = changes[1:] + [changes[0]]

# Print the first frequency that was reached twice
print(current_frequency)
"""

You can run this code by saving it to a file (e.g. `1_solution.py`) and running `python 1_solution.py`. This will print the first frequency that is reached twice to the console."""
