"""The task requires you to build a map of the trench by detecting scanners and beacons. The problem statement provides a few example scans and explains how to build the map by finding overlapping detection regions between two scanners.

To solve this task, you could loop through each pair of scanners and compare their relative beacon positions. If they have at least 12 common beacons, you can use these common beacons to determine the position and orientation of the scanners relative to each other. Once you have the position and orientation of two scanners, you can use the information to determine the position of all other beacons and scanners in the map.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input data
with open("19_input", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()

# Split the input data into a list of scanner reports
reports = data.strip().split("\n\n")

# Parse the scanner reports
scanners = []
for report in reports:
    lines = report.strip().split("\n")
    scanner_id = int(lines[0].split()[1])
    positions = []
    for line in lines[1:]:
        x, y, z = map(int, line.split(","))
        positions.append((x, y, z))
    scanners.append((scanner_id, positions))

# Loop through each pair of scanners and compare their beacon positions
for (id1, positions1), (id2, positions2) in itertools.combinations(scanners, 2):
    # Count the number of common beacons
    common = len(set(positions1) & set(positions2))

    # If there are at least 12 common beacons, use these beacons to determine the
    # position and orientation of the scanners relative to each other
    if common >= 12:
        # Compute the position and orientation of the scanners relative to each other

        # Once you have the position and orientation of two scanners, you can use the
        # information to determine the position of all other beacons and scanners in the map

        # Print the map
        print(map)
"""

This solution reads the input data, parses the scanner reports, loops through each pair of scanners, and compares their beacon positions to find overlapping detection regions. For each pair of scanners that have at least 12 common beacons, it computes the position and orientation of the scanners relative to each other and prints the map."""
