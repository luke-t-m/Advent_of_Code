"""To solve this problem, you need to find pairs of scanners that have at least 12 common beacons. The first step is to parse the input and store the scanners' positions and the beacons they detect.

One way to do this is to create a `Scanner` class with the following attributes:
- `id`: the scanner's ID, an integer
- `positions`: a list of tuples representing the positions of the beacons that the scanner detects, with each tuple containing the x, y, and z coordinates of the beacon
- `orientations`: a list of the scanner's orientations, each represented as a tuple of three signs (1 for positive, -1 for negative) indicating the directions of the x, y, and z axes

Here is an example of how you could define and use the `Scanner` class:
"""
class Scanner:
  def __init__(self, id, positions, orientations):
    self.id = id
    self.positions = positions
    self.orientations = orientations

# Parse the input
scanners = []
current_scanner = None
with open('19_input') as f:
  for line in f:
    line = line.strip()
    if line.startswith('--- scanner'):
      # Create a new scanner
      scanner_id = int(line.split()[2])
      current_scanner = Scanner(scanner_id, [], [])
      scanners.append(current_scanner)
    elif line.startswith('-'):
      # Parse the scanner's orientations
      signs = line.split()
      orientation = tuple(int(s) for s in signs)
      current_scanner.orientations.append(orientation)
    else:
      # Parse the beacon positions
      x, y, z = map(int, line.split(','))
      current_scanner.positions.append((x, y, z))

# Print the scanners
for scanner in scanners:
  print('Scanner', scanner.id)
  print('Positions:', scanner.positions)
  print('Orientations:', scanner.orientations)
"""

Once you have parsed the input and created the `Scanner` objects, you can find pairs of scanners with at least 12 common beacons. To do this, you can iterate over all pairs of scanners and compare their positions and orientations to find the common beacons.

Here is an example of how you could find pairs of scanners with at least 12 common beacons:
"""
# Find pairs of scanners with at least 12 common beacons
for scanner1, scanner2 in combinations(scanners, 2):
  # Check if the scanners have at least 12 common beacons
  common_beacons = set(scanner1.positions) & set(scanner2.positions)
  if len(common_beacons) >= 12:
    print('Found', len(common_beacons), 'common beacons between scanners', scanner1.id, 'and', scanner2.id)
"""

Once you have found pairs of scanners with at least 12 common beacons, you can use them to reconstruct the beacon map. To do this, you need to determine the relative positions of the scanners and the beacons they detect.

One way to determine the relative positions of the scanners and the beacons is to first"""
