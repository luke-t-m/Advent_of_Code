"""To solve this problem, you will need to find pairs of scanners that have at least 12 beacons in common. You can do this by iterating over each scanner and comparing its list of beacons with each other scanner's list of beacons. If there are at least 12 beacons in common, you can print the number of beacons in common as the answer.

Here is some sample Python code that you can use to solve this problem:

"""
# Read the input data from the file 19_input
with open("19_input") as f:
  data = f.read().strip().split("\n")

# Parse the input data into a list of scanners and their beacons
scanners = []
scanner = None
for line in data:
  if line.startswith("--- scanner"):
    if scanner:
      scanners.append(scanner)
    scanner = []
  else:
    scanner.append(line)

# Compare each scanner's list of beacons with each other scanner's list of beacons
for scanner1 in scanners:
  for scanner2 in scanners:
    # Skip the same scanner
    if scanner1 == scanner2:
      continue

    # Find the number of beacons in common
    common_beacons = set(scanner1) & set(scanner2)

    # If there are at least 12 beacons in common, print the answer
    if len(common_beacons) >= 12:
      print(len(common_beacons))
"""

Note that this code is not guaranteed to be correct, as it is only an example of how you might solve this problem. You will need to adapt this code to fit the specific requirements of the problem."""
