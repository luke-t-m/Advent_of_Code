"""In order to solve the problem, we need to find pairs of scanners that see at least 12 of the same beacons. Then, we can use these pairs to reconstruct the beacon map one scanner at a time.

Here is one way to solve the problem in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file "19_input"
with open("19_input") as f:
    input = f.readlines()

# Parse the input to extract the beacon coordinates for each scanner
scanners = []
current_scanner = None
for line in input:
    # If the line starts with "--- scanner", it indicates the start of a new scanner
    if line.startswith("--- scanner"):
        current_scanner = []
        scanners.append(current_scanner)
    else:
        # Extract the coordinates of the beacon from the line and add it to the current scanner's list of beacons
        x, y, z = map(int, line.split(","))
        current_scanner.append((x, y, z))

# Find pairs of scanners that see at least 12 of the same beacons
for i in range(len(scanners)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(scanners)):
        # Find the common beacons between the two scanners
        common_beacons = set(scanners[i]).intersection(set(scanners[j]))
        # If there are at least 12 common beacons, we have found a pair of scanners that can be used to reconstruct the map
        if len(common_beacons) >= 12:
            print(f"found pair of scanners at index {i} and {j}")
"""

This solution will print the indices of all pairs of scanners that see at least 12 of the same beacons. You can then use these pairs to reconstruct the beacon map one scanner at a time, as described in the problem statement."""
