"""The first thing you need to do is read the input from the file called "19_input".

To do this, you can use the `open()` function to open the file and the `read()` method to read the contents of the file into a string. You can then use the `split()` method to split the string into a list of strings, where each string represents the beacons detected by one scanner.

For example:
"""
with open("19_input") as f:
    input_string = f.read()
    scanners = input_string.split("\n")
    # scanners is now a list of strings, where each string represents the beacons detected by one scanner
"""

Once you have the input, you can begin processing it to find pairs of scanners that both see at least 12 of the same beacons.

To do this, you can loop over the list of scanners and compare each scanner to every other scanner in the list. For each pair of scanners, you can use the `intersection()` method to find the common beacons that are detected by both scanners. If the intersection has at least 12 elements, you have found a pair of scanners that both see at least 12 of the same beacons.

For example:
"""
for i in range(len(scanners)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(scanners)):
        # compare scanner i to scanner j
        common_beacons = set(scanners[i]).intersection(scanners[j])
        if len(common_beacons) >= 12:
            # we have found a pair of scanners that both see at least 12 of the same beacons
"""

Once you have found a pair of scanners that both see at least 12 of the same beacons, you can use the common beacons to determine the positions of the scanners relative to each other. This will allow you to reconstruct the beacon map one scanner at a time.

The solution to this problem will require some knowledge of geometry and linear algebra, as you will need to solve a system of linear equations to determine the positions of the scanners. I recommend consulting a textbook or online resource to learn more about how to do this.

Once you have determined the positions of the scanners, you can use them to reconstruct the beacon map and find the answer to the problem. To do this, you will need to calculate the positions of the beacons relative to each scanner and then use the positions of the scanners to determine the absolute positions of the beacons in 3D space.

Once you have the positions of all the beacons, you can use them to calculate the answer to the problem. This might involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a particular coordinate, or it might involve calculating the distance between two points. Again, I recommend consulting a textbook or online resource to learn more about how to do this.

To summarize, here are the steps you need to take to solve this problem:

1. Read the input from the file called "19_input"
2. Find pairs of scanners that both see at least 12 of the same beacons
3. Use the common beacons to determine the positions of the scanners relative to each other
4. Use the positions of the scanners to reconstruct the beacon map
5. Calculate the answer to the problem using the positions of the beacons."""
