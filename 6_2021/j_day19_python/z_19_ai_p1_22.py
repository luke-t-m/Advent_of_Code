"""First, we need to read the input from the file `19_input`. We can use the `open()` function to do that. We will also need to parse the input to extract the scanner data. We can do that by splitting the input on the `"--- scanner"` string, then iterating over the resulting list of strings and extracting the scanner data from each string.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to do this:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('19_input') as f:
    input_str = f.read()

# Split the input on the "--- scanner" string
scanners = input_str.split('--- scanner')

# Iterate over the scanners and extract the scanner data from each string
for scanner_str in scanners:
    # Split the scanner string on the newline character
    lines = scanner_str.split('\n')
    # Extract the scanner data from the lines
    scanner_data = []
    for line in lines:
        if line:  # Ignore empty lines
            x, y, z = map(int, line.split(','))
            scanner_data.append((x, y, z))
    # Print the scanner data
    print(scanner_data)
"""

Once we have the scanner data, we can compare the beacons seen by each pair of scanners and find pairs of scanners that see at least 12 common beacons. To do this, we can iterate over all pairs of scanners and check how many common beacons they see. If a pair of scanners sees at least 12 common beacons, we can add them to a list of pairs.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to do this:

"""
# List of pairs of scanners that see at least 12 common beacons
pairs = []

# Iterate over all pairs of scanners
for i, scanner1 in enumerate(scanners):
    for j in range(i+1, len(scanners)):
        scanner2 = scanners[j]
        # Find the common beacons seen by the two scanners
        common_beacons = set(scanner1) & set(scanner2)
        # Check if the number of common beacons is at least 12
        if len(common_beacons) >= 12:
            # Add the pair of scanners to the list
            pairs.append((scanner1, scanner2))

# Print the pairs of scanners that see at least 12 common beacons
print(pairs)
"""

Finally, once we have the pairs of scanners that see at least 12 common beacons, we can use those pairs to determine the positions of the scanners and beacons. To do this, we need to solve a system of equations that relates the positions of the beacons seen by each pair of scanners. Specifically, we can set up one equation for each dimension (x, y, and z) that relates the positions of the beacons seen by the two scanners in that dimension.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to do this:

"""
# Iterate over the pairs of scanners
for scanner1, scanner2 in pairs:
    # Solve the system of equations for the x, y, and z dimensions
    x_equation = ''  # Equation relating the x positions of the beacons seen by the two scanners
    y_equation = ''  # Equation relating the y positions of the beacons seen by the two"""
