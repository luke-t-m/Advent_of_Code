"""To solve this problem, you will need to read the input from the file "19_input" and then use it to build a map of the trench. Here is some sample code that you can use to do this:

This code will read the input from the file "19_input" and then use it to build a map of the trench. It will find pairs of scanners that have at least 12 overlapping beacons, and then add them to the trench map. Finally, it will print the number of pairs of scanners that were found."""
