"""To solve this problem, we first need to read the data from the file `19_input`. We can do this using the `open` and `read` functions in Python.

Next, we need to parse the data to extract the positions of the scanners and beacons. We can do this by splitting the data by newlines and then splitting each line on the comma to get the x, y, and z coordinates of each scanner and beacon.

Once we have the scanner data, we need to find pairs of scanners that have at least 12 beacons in common. We can do this by looping through all pairs of scanners, comparing the positions of the beacons that each scanner detects, and counting the number of beacons that are in common between the two scanners. If the number of common beacons is at least 12, we can add the pair of scanners to our list of valid scanner pairs.

        if common_beacons >= 12:
            valid_pairs.append((i, j))

Finally, once we have a list of valid scanner pairs, we can compute the answer to the problem by taking the average of the x, y, and z coordinates of the beacons detected by each scanner in the pair.

Putting it all together, we get the following solution:
