"""To solve this problem, we need to define a function that takes as input two snailfish numbers and returns their reduced sum.

We can start by defining a function that takes a snailfish number and returns its reduced form. This function will repeatedly apply the rules for reduction until the snailfish number is reduced.

Here is an implementation of this function in Python:

def reduce_snailfish_number(snailfish_number):
  # Check if any pair is nested inside four pairs
  if isinstance(snailfish_number, list) and len(snailfish_number) == 2 and isinstance(snailfish_number[0], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[1], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[0][0], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[0][1], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[1][0], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[1][1], list):
    # If so, explode the pair and return the reduced result
    left_regular_number = snailfish_number[0][0][0] if isinstance(snailfish_number[0][0][0], int) else 0
    right_regular_number = snailfish_number[1][1][1] if isinstance(snailfish_number[1][1][1], int) else 0
    return reduce_snailfish_number([left_regular_number + snailfish_number[0][1][0], right_regular_number + snailfish_number[1][0][1]])

  # Check if any regular number is 10 or greater
  if isinstance(snailfish_number, int) and snailfish_number >= 10:
    # If so, split the regular number and return the reduced result
    return reduce_snailfish_number([snailfish_number // 2, (snailfish_number + 1) // 2])

  # If neither rule applies, the snailfish number is already reduced
  return snailfish_number

We can now use this function to define a function that takes two snailfish numbers and returns their reduced sum. This function will first compute the sum of the two snailfish numbers using the rules of snailfish addition, and then apply the rules of reduction until the resulting snailfish number is reduced.

Here is an implementation of this function in Python:

def reduce_snailfish_sum(snailfish_number1, snailfish_number2):
  # Compute the sum of the two snailfish numbers
  snailfish_sum = [[snailfish_number1, snailfish_number2]]

  # Apply the rules of reduction until the snailfish number is reduced
  return reduce_snailfish_number(snailfish_sum)

Finally, we can print the reduced sum of the two snailfish numbers given in the problem statement by calling the `reduce_snailfish_sum` function with the appropriate arguments.

Here is the complete solution in Python:

def reduce_snailfish_number(snailfish_number):
  # Check if any pair is nested inside four pairs
  if isinstance(snailfish_number, list) and len(snailfish_number) == 2 and isinstance(snailfish_number[0], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[1], list) and isinstance(snailfish_number[0"""
