"""The first step is to create a function that adds two snailfish numbers. This can be done by creating a new pair that consists of the left parameter of the first number and the right parameter of the second number. For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

Next, we need to implement the reduction process. This involves repeatedly applying the two rules in the given order until no more rules apply. We can implement this using a while loop.
