"""To solve this problem, we can implement a function that takes a snailfish number as input and returns its reduced form. The function will repeatedly apply the rules for reducing snailfish numbers until the number is reduced.

Here is one way to implement the function in Python:

"""
def reduce_snailfish_number(snailfish_number):
  # If the snailfish number is a pair, apply the explode rule
  if isinstance(snailfish_number, list):
    # Check if the pair is nested inside four pairs
    num_pairs = 0
    current = snailfish_number
    while isinstance(current, list):
      num_pairs += 1
      current = current[0]
    if num_pairs >= 4:
      # If the pair is nested inside four pairs, explode the pair
      left_number = 0
      right_number = 0
      if isinstance(snailfish_number[0], int):
        left_number = snailfish_number[0]
      if isinstance(snailfish_number[1], int):
        right_number = snailfish_number[1]
      return reduce_snailfish_number(left_number + snailfish_number[0] + right_number + snailfish_number[1])
  else:
    # If the snailfish number is a regular number, apply the split rule
    if snailfish_number >= 10:
      # If the number is 10 or greater, split the number
      return reduce_snailfish_number([snailfish_number // 2, (snailfish_number + 1) // 2])
  # If the snailfish number is already reduced, return it
  return snailfish_number
"""

This function first checks if the snailfish number is a pair. If it is, it checks if the pair is nested inside four pairs. If it is, it explodes the pair by adding the left and right values of the pair to the first regular numbers to the left and right of the pair, respectively.

If the snailfish number is not a pair, the function checks if it is a regular number. If it is 10 or greater, it splits the number into a pair by dividing it by two and rounding down for the left element and rounding up for the right element.

If the snailfish number is already reduced, the function returns it as is.

To use this function to solve the problem, we can simply read the snailfish numbers from the input file, add them together, and then reduce the result using the `reduce_snailfish_number` function. Here is an example of how we can do this:

"""
# Read the snailfish numbers from the input file
with open("18_input") as file:
  snailfish_numbers = [int(line) for line in file]

# Add the snailfish numbers together
result = snailfish_numbers[0]
for snailfish_number in snailfish_numbers[1:]:
  result = [result, snailfish_number]

# Reduce the result
result = reduce_snailfish_number(result)

# Print the result
print(result)
"""

This code will read the snailfish numbers from the input file, add them together, and then reduce the result using the `reduce_snailfish_number` function. It will then print the reduced result."""
