"""The first thing to do is to parse the input and create a function to add two snailfish numbers. We can then use this function to add the two snailfish numbers given in the input.

Here is a possible solution:

This solution correctly adds the two snailfish numbers, but it does not reduce them. To reduce the snailfish numbers, we can define another function that applies the reduction rules described in the problem statement.

Here is a possible solution that reduces the snailfish numbers:

# Define a function to add two snailfish numbers

# Define a function to reduce a snailfish number

This solution correctly adds and reduces the snailfish numbers. It should work for the example in the problem statement. Note that the function `reduce_snailfish()` is recursive, which means that it calls itself to reduce nested snailfish numbers."""
