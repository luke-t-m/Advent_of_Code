"""To solve this problem in python, we can create a function that takes two snailfish numbers as input, adds them together, and then reduces the result until no further reduction is possible. Here is an example of how that function might look:

"""
def reduce(num):
  # Check if the number is a pair or a regular number
  if isinstance(num, list) and len(num) == 2:
    # If it's a pair, check if the pair is nested inside four pairs
    if isinstance(num[0], list) and isinstance(num[1], list) and len(num[0]) == 2 and len(num[1]) == 2:
      # If the pair is nested inside four pairs, explode it
      left = reduce(num[0][0])
      right = reduce(num[1][1])
      return [left, right]
    else:
      # Otherwise, reduce the left and right elements of the pair
      left = reduce(num[0])
      right = reduce(num[1])
      return [left, right]
  else:
    # If the number is a regular number, check if it is 10 or greater
    if num >= 10:
      # If it is, split it
      return [num // 2, (num + 1) // 2]
    else:
      # Otherwise, return the number as is
      return num

def add_and_reduce(a, b):
  # Add the two snailfish numbers together
  result = [a, b]

  # Reduce the result until no further reduction is possible
  while True:
    # Check if the result is a pair
    if isinstance(result, list) and len(result) == 2:
      # If it's a pair, check if it needs to be reduced
      if isinstance(result[0], list) and isinstance(result[1], list) and len(result[0]) == 2 and len(result[1]) == 2:
        # If the pair is nested inside four pairs, explode it
        left = reduce(result[0][0])
        right = reduce(result[1][1])
        result = [left, right]
      else:
        # Otherwise, reduce the left and right elements of the pair
        left = reduce(result[0])
        right = reduce(result[1])
        result = [left, right]
    else:
      # If the result is a regular number, check if it needs to be reduced

        result = [result // 2, (result + 1) // 2]
      else:

        return result

# Test the function with the example from the problem description
print(add_and_reduce([[4, 3], 4], [7, [[8, 4], 9]]))  # should print [8, 8]
