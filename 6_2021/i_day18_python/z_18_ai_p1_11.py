"""You can solve this problem by implementing a function that takes in two snailfish numbers, performs the addition operation, and then repeatedly applies the reduction rules until the resulting snailfish number is reduced.

Here is an example of how to solve this problem in Python:

"""
def reduce_snailfish_number(snailfish_number):
    # Apply explode rule if any pair is nested inside four pairs
    while any(isinstance(x, list) and len(x) == 2 for x in snailfish_number):
        for i, x in enumerate(snailfish_number):
            if isinstance(x, list) and len(x) == 2:
                # Find regular numbers to the left and right of the exploding pair
                left_reg_num = None
                for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                    if isinstance(snailfish_number[j], int):
                        left_reg_num = snailfish_number[j]
                        break

                for j in range(i + 1, len(snailfish_number)):
                    if isinstance(snailfish_number[j], int):
                        right_reg_num = snailfish_number[j]
                        break
                # Apply explode rule to the pair and update snailfish_number
                snailfish_number[i] = 0
                if left_reg_num is not None:
                    snailfish_number[i - 1] += x[0]
                if right_reg_num is not None:
                    snailfish_number[i + 1] += x[1]
                break
    # Apply split rule if any regular number is 10 or greater
    for i, x in enumerate(snailfish_number):
        if isinstance(x, int) and x >= 10:
            left = x // 2
            right = (x + 1) // 2
            snailfish_number[i] = [left, right]
    return snailfish_number

    # Perform addition and reduce the result
    result = [snailfish_number1, snailfish_number2]
    while True:
        result = reduce_snailfish_number(result)
        if all(isinstance(x, int) and x < 10 for x in result):
            break
    return result
