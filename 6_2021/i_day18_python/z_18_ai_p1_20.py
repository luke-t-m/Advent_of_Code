The code first reads the input from the file `18_input` and parses it into a list of snailfish numbers. It then defines a function `reduce` that reduces a snailfish number by applying the steps outlined in the problem description, and a function `add` that adds two snailfish numbers by forming a pair and reducing it until no further reductions are necessary. It also defines a function `sum` that computes the sum of a list of snailfish numbers by adding each number in the list to an initial sum of 0. Finally, it computes the sum of the snailfish numbers and prints the result."""
