"""The problem statement includes a description of the process that needs to be implemented in order to solve the problem. We can start by implementing this process.

First, we need to define a function that takes two snailfish numbers as input and returns their sum. This function should follow the rules described in the problem statement, which can be summarized as follows:

1. Add the two numbers to form a pair.
2. Reduce the resulting number by repeatedly applying the following steps, in order:
   a. If the number contains a pair nested inside four pairs, explode the leftmost such pair.
   b. If the number contains a regular number that is 10 or greater, split the leftmost such number.

We can start by implementing step 1, which is simply adding the two numbers to form a pair. We can do this using the built-in `zip` function, which takes two sequences as input and returns a sequence of pairs, where the first element of each pair is taken from the first sequence, the second element is taken from the second sequence, and so on. For example:

"""
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> z = zip(x, y)
>>> list(z)
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
"""

We can use this to implement step 1 of our function as follows:

"""
def add(x, y):
    # Step 1: add the two numbers to form a pair
    z = zip(x, y)
    # Step 2: reduce the resulting number
    # TODO: implement steps 2a and 2b

# Test the add function
assert add([1, 2], [3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
"""

Next, we can implement steps 2a and 2b of the function. We can do this by using a `while` loop that continues until the number is reduced, i.e., until neither of the steps 2a and 2b apply. Inside the loop, we can use a series of `if` statements to check for the conditions in steps 2a and 2b, and apply the corresponding actions if either condition is met.

For step 2a, we need to check if the number contains a pair nested inside four pairs. We can do this by recursively checking if each element of the number is a pair, and if so, calling the `add` function again on the elements of the pair. If any of these recursive calls returns a pair that is nested inside four pairs, we can apply the explode action by adding the left and right elements of the pair to the left and right regular numbers, respectively, and replacing the pair with the regular number 0.

For step 2b, we need to check if the number contains a regular number that is 10 or greater. If so, we can apply the split action by dividing the regular number by 2 and rounding down and up, respectively, to obtain the left and right elements of the pair, and replacing the regular number with this pair.

We can implement these steps as follows:

"""
def add(x, y):
    # Step 1: add the two numbers to form a pair
    z = zip(x, y)

    # Step 2: reduce the resulting number
    while True:
        # Check for step 2a: explode
        explode = False
        for i in range(len(z)):
            if isinstance(z[i], list):"""
