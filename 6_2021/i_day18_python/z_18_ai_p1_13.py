"""First, we need to define a function that can parse the input into a more usable data structure. We can do this by using a stack to keep track of nested pairs as we encounter them in the input string. When we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the last two elements off the stack and create a new pair with those elements. We continue this process until the input string has been fully parsed and the stack contains a single element, which is the parsed snailfish number.

Here is one possible implementation of this function:

"""
def parse_snailfish(input_str):
    stack = []
    cur_num = ""
    for c in input_str:
        if c == "[":
            # Push a new empty list onto the stack
            stack.append([])
        elif c == ",":
            # Add the current number to the current list
            stack[-1].append(cur_num)
            cur_num = ""
        elif c == "]":
            # Add the current number to the current list and pop the
            # last two elements off the stack, creating a new pair
            stack[-1].append(cur_num)
            cur_num = ""
            right = stack.pop()
            left = stack.pop()
            stack.append([left, right])
        else:
            # Add the character to the current number
            cur_num += c
    return stack[0]
"""

Next, we need to define a function that can add two snailfish numbers. We can do this by simply creating a new pair with the two input numbers as the left and right elements.

Here is one possible implementation of this function:

"""
def add_snailfish(num1, num2):
    return [num1, num2]
"""

Now, we need to define a function that can reduce a snailfish number. This function should repeatedly apply the reduction rules until the snailfish number is reduced.

To implement this function, we can use a stack to keep track of regular numbers and pairs as we traverse the snailfish number. When we encounter a regular number, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a pair, we pop the last two elements off the stack (if they exist), apply the explode rule, and push the resulting regular number back onto the stack.

Here is one possible implementation of this function:

"""
def reduce_snailfish(num):
    stack = []
    for element in num:
        if isinstance(element, int):
            # If the element is a regular number, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(element)
        else:
            # If the element is a pair, apply the explode rule and
            # push the resulting regular number onto the stack
            left = 0
            right = 0
            if len(stack) >= 2:
                left = stack.pop()
                right = stack.pop()
            left_num, right_num = element
            if isinstance(left_num, int) and left_num >= 10:
                # Apply the split rule to the left element
                left_num = split_number(left_num)
            if isinstance(right_num, int) and right_num >= 10:
                # Apply the split rule to the right element
                right_num = split_number(right_num)
            stack.append(left + left_num + right_"""
