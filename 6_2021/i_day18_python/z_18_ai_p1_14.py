"""To solve this problem in Python, we can use a recursive function to apply the rules of reduction and addition to the input numbers. 

First, we need to define the input numbers and the function that will reduce them. We can do this with the following code:

"""
# Read the input numbers from the file "18_input"
with open("18_input") as f:
    numbers = f.readlines()

# Define a function to reduce a snailfish number
def reduce(number):
    # If the number is a regular number, return it
    if isinstance(number, int):
        return number
    # Otherwise, apply the rules of reduction
    else:
        # If the number has four pairs nested inside it, explode the leftmost pair
        if number[0] == number[1] == [[[...]]]:
            # Add the left value of the exploding pair to the regular number to its left
            # (if there is one) and the right value of the exploding pair to the regular
            # number to its right (if there is one)
            number[0] += number[1][0][0][0]
            number[1][0][0][1] += number[1][0][0][1]
            # Replace the exploding pair with the regular number 0
            number[1][0][0] = 0
        # If the number has any regular numbers that are 10 or greater, split the leftmost
        # such number
        elif any(isinstance(x, int) and x >= 10 for x in number):
            # Divide the leftmost number greater than or equal to 10 by 2 and round down
            # to get the left value of the new pair, and divide it by 2 and round up to
            # get the right value of the new pair
            number[number.index(next(x for x in number if isinstance(x, int) and x >= 10))] = [number[number.index(next(x for x in number if isinstance(x, int) and x >= 10))] // 2, (number[number.index(next(x for x in number if isinstance(x, int) and x >= 10))] + 1) // 2]
        # If none of the above conditions are met, the number is reduced
        else:
            return number

# Reduce each input number
reduced_numbers = [reduce(number) for number in numbers]
"""

Next, we need to define the function that will add two snailfish numbers. We can do this with the following code:

"""
# Define a function to add two snailfish numbers
def add(number1, number2):
    # Form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator
    number = [number1, number2]
    # Reduce the resulting number
    reduced_number = reduce(number)
    # If the resulting number is not reduced, keep reducing it until it is
    while isinstance(reduced_number, list):
        reduced_number = reduce(reduced_number)
    # Return the reduced number
    return reduced_number

# Add each pair of input numbers
added_numbers = [add(numbers[i], numbers[i + 1]) for i in range(0, len(numbers), 2)]
"""

Finally, we can print the reduced and added numbers with the following code:
"""
