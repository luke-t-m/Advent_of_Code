"""To solve this problem, we can write a function that takes a snailfish number as input and returns the reduced result of that number. The function should implement the reduction rules outlined in the problem description, applying them repeatedly until the number is reduced.

Here is one possible implementation in Python:

"""
def reduce(number):
    # If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
    if isinstance(number, list) and len(number) == 2 and isinstance(number[0], list) and len(number[0]) == 2 and isinstance(number[0][0], list) and len(number[0][0]) == 2 and isinstance(number[0][0][0], list) and len(number[0][0][0]) == 2:
        # The leftmost such pair explodes.
        left_regular_number = number[0][0][0][0]
        right_regular_number = number[0][0][0][1]
        if isinstance(left_regular_number, int) and left_regular_number < 10:
            left_regular_number += number[0][0][1]
        if isinstance(right_regular_number, int) and right_regular_number < 10:
            right_regular_number += number[0][1]
        number = [[[[0, left_regular_number], number[0][1]], number[1]], 0]

    # If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.
    if isinstance(number, list):
        for i in range(len(number)):
            if isinstance(number[i], int) and number[i] >= 10:
                # The regular number splits.
                number[i] = [number[i] // 2, (number[i] + 1) // 2]
                break
            elif isinstance(number[i], list):
                number[i] = reduce(number[i])

    return number
"""

This function uses recursion to handle nested pairs, and applies the reduction rules in the order specified in the problem description.

To use this function to solve the problem, we can read the input from the file `18_input` and apply the `reduce` function to each snailfish number in the input. The final result should be the reduced form of the sum of all the input numbers.

Here is an example of how to use the `reduce` function to solve the problem:

"""
# Read the input numbers from the file.
with open('18_input') as f:
    numbers = [eval(line.strip()) for line in f]

# Apply the reduce function to each input number.
reduced_numbers = [reduce(number) for number in numbers]

# Compute the sum of the reduced numbers.
result = reduced_numbers[0]
for reduced_number in reduced_numbers[1:]:
    result = reduce([result, reduced_number])

# Print the result.
print(result)
"""

This code should correctly solve the problem and print the final result."""
