"""The problem requires us to implement a simple function to add two snailfish numbers. Snailfish numbers are a pair of lists, and the addition operation is simply concatenation of the two lists. The problem also requires us to reduce the resulting snailfish number by repeatedly applying the following operations:

1. If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
2. If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.

Here is a simple implementation of this function in Python:

"""
def add_snailfish_numbers(snailfish1, snailfish2):
    # Add the snailfish numbers by concatenating the two lists
    result = snailfish1 + snailfish2
    
    # Reduce the result
    while True:
        # Check if any pair is nested inside four pairs
        for i in range(len(result) - 4):
            if isinstance(result[i], list) and isinstance(result[i+1], list) and isinstance(result[i+2], list) and isinstance(result[i+3], list) and isinstance(result[i+4], list):
                # Explode the leftmost such pair
                left = result[i][0]
                right = result[i][1]
                result[i] = 0
                if i > 0 and isinstance(result[i-1], int):
                    result[i-1] += left
                if i < len(result) - 1 and isinstance(result[i+1], int):
                    result[i+1] += right
                break
        else:
            # Check if any regular number is 10 or greater
            for i in range(len(result)):
                if isinstance(result[i], int) and result[i] >= 10:
                    # Split the leftmost such regular number
                    result[i] = [result[i] // 2, result[i] // 2 + result[i] % 2]
                    break
            else:
                # No further reduction is possible, so return the result
                return result
