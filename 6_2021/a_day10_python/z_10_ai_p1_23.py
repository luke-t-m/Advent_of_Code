"""First, read the input from the file `10_input`. Then, iterate through each line of the input and keep track of the opening and closing characters. If a closing character is encountered that doesn't match the last opening character, that line is corrupted and we can stop processing it. Otherwise, if the line is complete and all of the opening and closing characters match up, add the corresponding syntax error score to the total syntax error score.
