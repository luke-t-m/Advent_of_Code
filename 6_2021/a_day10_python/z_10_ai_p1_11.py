"""First, let's define a function `syntax_error_score` that will take in a string and return the syntax error score for that string.

To do this, we will iterate through the string, keeping track of any open brackets we encounter, and adding their corresponding closing brackets to a stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we will check if it matches the last bracket on the stack. If it does, we will pop the last bracket off the stack. If it doesn't, we will stop iterating and return the syntax error score for the bracket we encountered.

Here is some pseudocode to help explain this more clearly:

"""
def syntax_error_score(string):
    # Create a stack to store open brackets.
    stack = []

    # Iterate through the string.
    for char in string:
        # If the character is an open bracket, add its corresponding closing bracket to the stack.
        if char in ["(", "[", "{", "<"]:
            stack.append(get_closing_bracket(char))
        # If the character is a closing bracket, check if it matches the last bracket on the stack.
        # If it does, pop the last bracket off the stack.
        # If it doesn't, return the syntax error score for the bracket we encountered.
        else if char in [")", "]", "}", ">"]:
            if char == stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return get_syntax_error_score(char)
    # If we have reached the end of the string and the stack is empty, return 0.
    # Otherwise, return the syntax error score for the last bracket on the stack.
    if stack:
        return get_syntax_error_score(stack[-1])
    else:
        return 0
"""

We will also need to define the `get_closing_bracket` and `get_syntax_error_score` functions that are used in the pseudocode above.

The `get_closing_bracket` function will take in an open bracket and return its corresponding closing bracket. This can be done with a simple dictionary mapping open brackets to closing brackets:

"""
def get_closing_bracket(char):
    bracket_mapping = {
        "(": ")",
        "[": "]",
        "{": "}",
        "<": ">",
    }
    return bracket_mapping[char]
"""

The `get_syntax_error_score` function will take in a closing bracket and return its syntax error score. This can also be done with a dictionary mapping closing brackets to their syntax error scores:

"""
def get_syntax_error_score(char):
    syntax_error_score = {
        ")": 3,
        "]": 57,
        "}": 1197,
        ">": 25137,
    }
    return syntax_error_score[char]
"""

Now that we have defined all of the necessary functions, we can use them to solve the problem. First, we need to read the input from the file `10_input`. We can do this with the following code:

"""
with open("10_input") as f:
    input_lines = f.readlines()
"""

Next, we need to iterate through the input lines and"""
