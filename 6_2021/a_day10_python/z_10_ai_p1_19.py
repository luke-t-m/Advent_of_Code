This code reads the input from a file called `10_input` and loops over each line in the input. For each line, it loops over each character in the line. If the character is an opening character, it pushes it onto a stack. If the character is a closing character, it pops the last opening character from the stack and checks if the closing character matches the corresponding opening character. If it does, it adds the score of the closing character to the total score. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop and moves on to the next line. Finally, it prints the total score."""
