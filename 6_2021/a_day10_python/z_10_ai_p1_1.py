"""To solve this problem, we need to read the input from the file "10_input" and process each line of the input to check if the chunks in the line are well-formed and not corrupted. We can do this by iterating over the characters in each line and using a stack to keep track of the open chunks.

We start by pushing the opening character of a chunk onto the stack whenever we encounter one. Then, when we encounter a closing character, we pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the closing character. If it does not match, then the line is corrupted and we can stop processing the line and move on to the next one.

We can use a dictionary to map each closing character to its corresponding opening character, so that we can easily check if the top element of the stack matches the closing character.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file "10_input"
with open("10_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Define a dictionary that maps closing characters to their corresponding opening characters
mapping = {
    ")": "(",
    "]": "[",
    "}": "{",
    "&gt;": "&lt;",
}

# Process each line of the input
for line in lines:
    # Initialize an empty stack
    stack = []

    # Iterate over the characters in the line
    for c in line:
        # If the character is an opening character, push it onto the stack
        if c in mapping.values():
            stack.append(c)

        # If the character is a closing character
        elif c in mapping:
            # If the stack is empty, the line is corrupted
            if not stack:
                print("Corrupted line:", line)
                break

            # Pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the closing character
            if stack.pop() != mapping[c]:
                print("Corrupted line:", line)
                break

    # If the stack is not empty at the end of the line, the line is corrupted
    if stack:
        print("Corrupted line:", line)
"""

This code will print all the corrupted lines from the input. To calculate the syntax error score for each line, we can modify the code to keep track of the total score and add the appropriate score for each incorrect closing character:

"""
# Read the input from the file "10_input"
with open("10_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Define a dictionary that maps closing characters to their corresponding opening characters
mapping = {
    ")": "(",
    "]": "[",
    "}": "{",
    "&gt;": "&lt;",
}

# Define a dictionary that maps closing characters to their corresponding scores
scores = {
    ")": 3,
    "]": 57,
    "}": 1197,
    "&gt;": 25137,
}

# Initialize the total score to 0
total_score = 0

# Process each line of the input
for line in lines:
    # Initialize an empty stack
    stack = []

    # Iterate over the characters in the line
    for c in line:
        # If the character is an opening character, push it onto the stack
        if c"""
