"""To solve this problem, we need to read in the input from the file called "10_input" and process each line in the file. We will use a stack to keep track of the opening characters we encounter. If we encounter a closing character that doesn't match the last opening character we saw, we will stop processing the line and record the score for that line. Otherwise, we will continue processing the line until we reach the end, at which point we will remove the last character from the stack. Here is one way to implement this in Python:

"""
# Create a dictionary that maps closing characters to scores
SCORES = {
    ")": 3,
    "]": 57,
    "}": 1197,
    ">": 25137
}

# Open the input file
with open("10_input") as f:
    # Read in the lines from the file
    lines = f.readlines()

    # Iterate over the lines
    for line in lines:
        # Create an empty stack
        stack = []

        # Initialize the score for this line to 0
        score = 0

        # Iterate over the characters in the line
        for char in line:
            # If the character is an opening character, add it to the stack
            if char in ["(", "[", "{", "<"]:
                stack.append(char)

            # Otherwise, if the character is a closing character
            elif char in [")", "]", "}", ">"]:
                # If the stack is empty, stop processing the line and record the score
                if not stack:
                    score += SCORES[char]
                    break
                else:
                    # If the closing character doesn't match the last opening character,
                    # stop processing the line and record the score
                    if char != {"(": ")", "[": "]", "{": "}", "<": ">"}[stack[-1]]:
                        score += SCORES[char]
                        break

                    # If the closing character does match the last opening character,
                    # remove the last opening character from the stack
                    else:
                        stack.pop()

        # After processing the line, if the stack is not empty, the line is corrupted
        # so we record the score for the final closing character
        if stack:
            score += SCORES[{"(": ")", "[": "]", "{": "}", "<": ">"}[stack[-1]]]

        # Print the score for this line
        print(score)

Note that this code assumes that the input file is in the same directory as the script. You will need to adjust the code if the input file is in a different location."""
