This solution reads the input file line by line and calculates the syntax error score for each line. It uses a stack to keep track of the currently open brackets, and whenever it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if it matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it doesn't, it returns the score for the closing bracket. Otherwise, it keeps track of the score by adding the points for the closing bracket to the current score."""
