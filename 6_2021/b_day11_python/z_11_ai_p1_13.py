This solution simulates 100 steps of the process described in the problem statement. At each step, it increases the energy of all octopuses by 1, then checks which octopuses have an energy level greater than 9 and flashes them. When an octopus flashes, it increases the energy level of all adjacent octopuses by 1, and this process continues until no more octopuses have their energy level increased beyond 9. Finally, it sets the energy level of all flashed octopuses to 0, and repeats this process for 100 steps. At the end, it counts the number of octopuses that have an energy level greater than 0, and prints this number as the solution to the problem."""
