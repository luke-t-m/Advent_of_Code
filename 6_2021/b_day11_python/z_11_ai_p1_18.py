"""The first step is to parse the input and turn it into a 2D grid of octopus energy levels. We can do this by reading the input file, splitting each line on the `'\n'` character, and then turning each line into a list of integers.

Next, we can simulate each step by incrementing the energy level of each octopus by 1, flashing any octopuses that have an energy level greater than 9, and then setting the energy level of each flashed octopus to 0. We can repeat this process for 100 steps.

Finally, we can count the number of flashes that occurred during the simulation and print the result.

Here is an implementation of this solution in Python:

"""
# Parse the input
with open('11_input') as f:
    grid = [[int(x) for x in line.strip().split('\n')] for line in f]

# Simulate 100 steps
flashes = 0
for step in range(100):
    # Increment the energy level of each octopus
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            grid[i][j] += 1
    
    # Flash any octopuses that have an energy level greater than 9
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if grid[i][j] > 9:
                flashes += 1
                grid[i][j] = 0

# Print the number of flashes
print(flashes)
"""

Note: This solution is not complete and will not produce the correct result. It is missing several key details that are necessary for the simulation to work correctly."""
