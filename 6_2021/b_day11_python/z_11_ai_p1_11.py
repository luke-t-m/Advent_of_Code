"""This problem can be solved by simulating the octopuses' energy levels for 100 steps and keeping track of the number of flashes that occur.

We can represent the grid of octopuses as a two-dimensional list, with each element representing the energy level of an octopus at that position. We can then iterate over the elements in the list, updating the energy levels according to the rules given in the problem statement.

Here is one way to solve the problem in Python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the octopus energy levels into a 2D list
with open('11_input') as f:
    octopuses = [[int(c) for c in line.strip()] for line in f]

# Track the number of flashes that occur
flashes = 0

# Simulate 100 steps
for step in range(100):
    # Increment the energy level of each octopus by 1
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            octopuses[i][j] += 1

    # Find the octopuses that have energy levels greater than 9 and flash
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if octopuses[i][j] > 9:
                # Increment the number of flashes
                flashes += 1
                # Set the energy level of the flashing octopus to 0
                octopuses[i][j] = 0
                # Increment the energy level of all adjacent octopuses
                if i > 0:
                    octopuses[i-1][j] += 1
                if i < 9:
                    octopuses[i+1][j] += 1
                if j > 0:
                    octopuses[i][j-1] += 1
                if j < 9:
                    octopuses[i][j+1] += 1

# Print the number of flashes that occurred
print(flashes)
"""

After running this code, the number of flashes that occurred during the 100 steps will be printed to the console."""
