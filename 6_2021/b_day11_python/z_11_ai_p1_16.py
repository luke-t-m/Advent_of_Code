"""Here is a solution to the problem in python:

for step in range(100):
    # increase energy level of each octopus by 1

"""

This solution reads the input from a file called "11_input". The input must be a grid of octopuses, where each octopus is represented by a single integer between 0 and 9. Each line of the input file should contain the energy levels of the octopuses in a single row of the grid, separated by spaces.

The solution simulates 100 steps, during which it increases the energy levels of all octopuses by 1, and then checks if any octopuses have an energy level greater than 9. If any octopus has an energy level greater than 9, it is considered to have flashed, and the solution increases the energy levels of all adjacent octopuses by 1. This process continues until no octopuses have an energy level greater than 9. Finally, the solution sets the energy level of each octopus that flashed to 0, and then counts the total number of flashes that occurred during the 100 steps. The answer is printed to the console."""
