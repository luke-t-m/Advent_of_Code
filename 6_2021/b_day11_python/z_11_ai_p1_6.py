"""This looks like a simulation problem. The goal is to simulate the octopuses gaining energy, flashing and then resetting their energy level until no more octopuses can flash.

To solve this problem, we will need to read the initial state of the octopuses from the `11_input` file. We can use the `open()` function to open the file and then read the initial state of the octopuses from it.

Next, we will need to simulate the octopuses gaining energy and flashing. We can do this by using a `while` loop that continues until no more octopuses can flash. Inside the loop, we will first increase the energy level of each octopus by 1. Then, we will find all octopuses with an energy level greater than 9 and flash them. Flashing an octopus will increase the energy level of all adjacent octopuses by 1. If this causes any octopus to have an energy level greater than 9, it will flash too. This process will continue until no more octopuses can flash. Finally, we will set the energy level of all octopuses that flashed to 0.

After the simulation is complete, we can print the final state of the octopuses as the answer.

Here is some sample code for solving this problem:

"""
# Open the input file
with open('11_input', 'r') as f:
    # Read the initial state of the octopuses
    octopuses = [[int(c) for c in line.strip()] for line in f.readlines()]

# Keep simulating until no more octopuses can flash
while True:
    # Keep track of whether any octopuses can flash
    can_flash = False
    
    # Increase the energy level of each octopus by 1
    for i in range(len(octopuses)):
        for j in range(len(octopuses[i])):
            octopuses[i][j] += 1
    
    # Find all octopuses with an energy level greater than 9 and flash them
    for i in range(len(octopuses)):
        for j in range(len(octopuses[i])):
            if octopuses[i][j] > 9:
                can_flash = True
                flash_octopus(octopuses, i, j)
    
    # If no octopuses can flash, stop simulating
    if not can_flash:
        break

# Print the final state of the octopuses
for i in range(len(octopuses)):
    print(''.join(str(c) for c in octopuses[i]))
"""

We can define the `flash_octopus()` function to flash an octopus at a given position and increase the energy level of all adjacent octopuses by 1. This function should take in a list of lists representing the octopuses and the position of the octopus to flash, and then update the octopuses list in-place.

Here is an example implementation of the `flash_octopus()` function:

"""
# This function flashes an octopus at the given position and increases the energy
# level of all adjacent octopuses by 1
def flash_octopus(octopuses, i, j):
    # Set the energy level of the octopus at the given position to 0
    octopuses[i][j] = 0
    
    #
