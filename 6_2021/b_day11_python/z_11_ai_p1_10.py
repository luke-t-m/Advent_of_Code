"""To solve this problem, we can simulate the steps by following the instructions provided in the problem statement. First, we need to read the input from the file `11_input`. We can do this using the `open()` and `read()` functions in Python.

"""
# Open the file
with open('11_input', 'r') as input_file:
  # Read the input
  input_data = input_file.read()
"""

Next, we need to parse the input to get the initial energy levels of the octopuses. The input is given as a string of digits with each line representing a row in the grid of octopuses. We can use the `split()` function to split the input string into a list of rows, and then use a list comprehension to convert each row into a list of integers representing the energy levels of the octopuses in that row.

"""
# Split the input string into a list of rows
rows = input_data.split('\n')

# Convert each row into a list of integers
grid = [list(map(int, row)) for row in rows]
"""

With the initial state of the octopuses represented as a grid of integers, we can now simulate the steps by iterating over the grid and updating the energy levels of the octopuses. In each step, we need to increase the energy level of each octopus by 1, and then check for octopuses with an energy level greater than 9. For each such octopus, we need to increase the energy level of all adjacent octopuses by 1, including octopuses that are diagonally adjacent. If this causes any octopus to have an energy level greater than 9, we need to repeat the process for that octopus as well. Finally, we need to set the energy level of any octopus that flashed during the step to 0.

We can implement this by using a nested `for` loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the grid, and then use an `if` statement to check if the current octopus has an energy level greater than 9. If so, we can use a `for` loop to iterate over the adjacent octopuses and increase their energy levels by 1. We can also use a `set` to keep track of the octopuses that have flashed during the step, and then iterate over this set at the end of the step to set the energy levels of these octopuses to 0.
