"""The given problem is a simulation problem that can be solved by a program. In the following program, we will simulate the steps mentioned in the prompt.

We will start by reading the input from the file `11_input`. Then, we will create a 2-dimensional grid of size 10 x 10 to store the energy levels of octopuses. Finally, we will perform the following steps in a loop until no octopus flashes during a step:

1. Increment the energy level of all octopuses by 1.
2. Flash octopuses that have an energy level greater than 9 and increment the energy levels of all adjacent octopuses.
3. Set the energy levels of all octopuses that flashed to 0.

At the end of the loop, we will print the grid of octopus energy levels as the solution.

Here is the program in Python:
