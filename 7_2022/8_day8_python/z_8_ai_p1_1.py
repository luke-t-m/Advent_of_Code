"""In order to solve this problem, we will need to read in the input from the `8_input` file and then iterate through each row and column in the grid to determine how many trees are visible from outside the grid.

First, let's define a function that takes in a grid of trees and returns the number of visible trees:

"""
def count_visible_trees(grid):
    # Initialize the count of visible trees to 0
    count = 0

    # Iterate through each row in the grid
    for row in grid:
        # Iterate through each tree in the row
        for tree in row:
            # If the tree is not the shortest (0), increment the count of visible trees
            if tree != 0:
                count += 1

    # Return the count of visible trees
    return count
"""

Next, we need to read in the input from the `8_input` file and store it in a variable. We can do this using the `open` function and the `readlines` method:

"""
# Open the 8_input file and read in the lines
with open("8_input", "r") as input_file:
    lines = input_file.readlines()
"""

Now that we have the input stored in the `lines` variable, we need to convert each line of input into a list of integers representing the trees in that row. We can do this by using the `split` method to split each line on the newline character and then using the `map` function to convert each string to an integer:

"""
# Convert each line of input into a list of integers representing the trees in that row
grid = [list(map(int, line.split("\n"))) for line in lines]
"""

Finally, we can use the `count_visible_trees` function to count the number of visible trees in the grid and print the result:

"""
# Count the number of visible trees in the grid
count = count_visible_trees(grid)

# Print the result
print(count)
"""

Putting everything together, the complete solution to this problem in Python is:

"""
def count_visible_trees(grid):
    # Initialize the count of visible trees to 0
    count = 0

    # Iterate through each row in the grid
    for row in grid:
        # Iterate through each tree in the row
        for tree in row:
            # If the tree is not the shortest (0), increment the count of visible trees
            if tree != 0:
                count += 1

    # Return the count of visible trees
    return count


# Open the 8_input file and read in the lines
with open("8_input", "r") as input_file:
    lines = input_file.readlines()

# Convert each line of input into a list of integers representing the trees in that row
grid = [list(map(int, line.split("\n"))) for line in lines]

# Count the number of visible trees in the grid
count = count_visible_trees(grid)

# Print the result
print(count)
