"""To solve this problem, you will need to read the input from a file called "8_input". You can do this using the following code:

"""
with open("8_input", "r") as f:
    # Read the input
    input = f.read()
"""

Next, you will need to parse the input to extract the heights of the trees in the grid. One way to do this is to split the input on the newline character `\n`, which will give you a list of strings where each string is the height of a tree in a row. You can then convert each string to a list of integers using the `map` function. For example:

"""
# Split the input on newlines
rows = input.split("\n")

# Convert each row string to a list of integers
rows = [list(map(int, row)) for row in rows]
"""

Now that you have the grid of trees, you can iterate through each tree and check if it is visible from the top, bottom, left, or right. To do this, you can check the heights of the trees in the same row or column as the current tree, and see if any of them are taller than the current tree. If there are no taller trees, then the current tree is visible.

For example, to check if a tree at position `(i, j)` is visible from the top, you can do the following:

"""
# Check if the tree at (i, j) is visible from the top
for k in range(i):
    # If there is a taller tree in the same column, then (i, j) is not visible from the top
    if rows[k][j] > rows[i][j]:
        break
else:
    # If we didn't find any taller trees, then (i, j) is visible from the top
    visible_count += 1
"""

You can repeat this process for the bottom, left, and right directions to check if the tree is visible from those directions. Once you have checked all four directions, you can add the current tree to the total count of visible trees.

Finally, you can print the total count of visible trees to get the answer to the problem. Here is the complete code to solve the problem:

"""
with open("8_input", "r") as f:
    # Read the input
    input = f.read()

# Split the input on newlines
rows = input.split("\n")

# Convert each row string to a list of integers
rows = [list(map(int, row)) for row in rows]

# The total count of visible trees
visible_count = 0

# Iterate through each tree in the grid
for i in range(len(rows)):
    for j in range(len(rows[i])):
        # Check if the tree at (i, j) is visible from the top
        for k in range(i):
            if rows[k][j] > rows[i][j]:
                break
        else:
            visible_count += 1
        
        # Check if the tree at (i, j) is visible from the bottom
        for k in range(i+1, len(rows)):
            if rows[k][j] > rows[i][j]:
                break
        else:
            visible_count += 1
        
        #"""
