Next, we need to write a function that determines whether a tree at a given location is visible or not. This function should take the grid, the current tree's row and column, and the direction we are looking in (up, down, left, or right) as input. It should return `True` if the tree is visible, and `False` otherwise.

            if grid[r][col] > grid[row][col]:

Now, we can loop through the trees in the grid and use the `is_tree_visible` function to determine whether each tree is visible or not. We can then count the number of visible trees and print the result.

# Count the number of visible trees
num_visible_trees = 0

print(num_visible_trees)

Putting it all together, we get the following solution:
