"""To solve this problem, we can create a function that takes the grid of trees as input, and then iterates through each row and column in the grid. For each row and column, we can find the maximum height tree, and then check if any other trees between the maximum height tree and the edge of the grid are taller than the maximum height tree. If there are no trees taller than the maximum height tree, we can increment a counter. Finally, we can return the counter, which will contain the number of trees visible from the outside of the grid.

Here is an implementation of this solution in Python:

"""
def count_visible_trees(grid):
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0])

    # Keep track of the number of visible trees.
    num_visible = 0

    # Iterate through each row and column in the grid.
    for i in range(num_rows):
        for j in range(num_cols):
            # Find the maximum height tree in the current row or column.
            max_height = max(grid[i][j:])

            # Check if any trees between the maximum height tree and the edge of the grid are taller.
            if all(x <= max_height for x in grid[i][j+1:]):
                num_visible += 1

    return num_visible

# Open the input file and read the grid of trees.
with open("8_input") as f:
    grid = [[int(x) for x in line.strip()] for line in f]

# Print the number of trees visible from the outside of the grid.
print(count_visible_trees(grid))
