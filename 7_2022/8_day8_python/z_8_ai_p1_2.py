"""To solve this problem, we need to read the input from the file `8_input` and then count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid when looking directly along a row or column. We can do this by iterating over each row and column and checking if the tree is visible from outside the grid.

Here is one possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file `8_input`
with open("8_input", "r") as f:
    # Split the input by newline characters to get a list of strings
    # representing each row in the grid
    rows = f.read().strip().split("\n")

# Count the number of visible trees
num_visible = 0

# Iterate over each row and column in the grid
for r in range(len(rows)):
    for c in range(len(rows[r])):
        # Get the height of the current tree
        tree_height = int(rows[r][c])

        # Check if the tree is visible from the left or top
        if (r == 0 or int(rows[r-1][c]) < tree_height) and (c == 0 or int(rows[r][c-1]) < tree_height):
            # If the tree is visible from the left or top, increment the
            # counter
            num_visible += 1

# Print the number of visible trees
print(num_visible)
