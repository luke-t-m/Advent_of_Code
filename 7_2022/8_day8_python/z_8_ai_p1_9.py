"""The problem is asking for the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid. To solve this problem, we need to go through each tree in the grid and check if it is visible from any direction.

We can solve this problem by reading the input from the file `8_input` and storing it in a list of strings. Then, we can iterate through each tree in the grid and check if it is visible from any direction by comparing its height to the heights of the trees in its row and column. We can then keep a count of the number of visible trees and print the final count at the end.

Here is a solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('8_input', 'r') as f:
    trees = [line.strip() for line in f]

# Initialize a count of visible trees
count = 0

# Iterate through each tree in the grid
for i in range(len(trees)):
    for j in range(len(trees[i])):
        # Check if the tree is visible from the left
        if j > 0 and trees[i][j] > trees[i][j - 1]:
            count += 1
        
        # Check if the tree is visible from the right
        if j < len(trees[i]) - 1 and trees[i][j] > trees[i][j + 1]:
            count += 1
        
        # Check if the tree is visible from the top
        if i > 0 and trees[i][j] > trees[i - 1][j]:
            count += 1
        
        # Check if the tree is visible from the bottom
        if i < len(trees) - 1 and trees[i][j] > trees[i + 1][j]:
            count += 1

# Print the final count of visible trees
print(count)
