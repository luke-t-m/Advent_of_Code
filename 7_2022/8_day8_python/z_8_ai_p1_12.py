"""The first step is to read the input from the file named `8_input`. We can do this using the `open` function and the `readlines` method to read all of the lines in the file as a list of strings.

We'll also need to create an empty list to store the number of visible trees for each row and column.

"""
with open('8_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Create an empty list to store the number of visible trees
# for each row and column
visible_trees = []
"""

Next, we need to loop through each row and column in the input and count the number of visible trees. To do this, we can loop through each character in the row or column and compare it to the other characters in that row or column. If the character is taller than all of the other characters in the row or column, we can increment the count of visible trees.

For example, to count the number of visible trees in the first row of the input, we can do the following:

"""
# Loop through each character in the first row
for i in range(len(lines[0])):
    # Compare the character at index i to all other characters
    # in the row
    tallest = True
    for j in range(len(lines[0])):
        if i != j and lines[0][i] < lines[0][j]:
            tallest = False
            break
    # If the character at index i is the tallest in the row,
    # increment the count of visible trees
    if tallest:
        visible_trees[0] += 1
"""

We can do the same thing for each column by looping through each character in the column and comparing it to all other characters in the column.

Finally, we can print the total number of visible trees by adding up the counts for each row and column.

Here is the complete solution:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('8_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Create an empty list to store the number of visible trees
# for each row and column
visible_trees = []

# Loop through each row and column
for i in range(len(lines)):
    for j in range(len(lines[i])):
        # If we haven't counted the number of visible trees
        # for this row or column yet, initialize the count to 0
        if i >= len(visible_trees):
            visible_trees.append(0)
        if j >= len(visible_trees):
            visible_trees.append(0)

        # Compare the character at index j in the row or column
        # at index i to all other characters in the row or column
        tallest = True
        for k in range"""
