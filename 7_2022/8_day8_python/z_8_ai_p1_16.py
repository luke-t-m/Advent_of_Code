"""The first step is to read the input from the file called `8_input`. In Python, this can be done with the following code:

"""
with open("8_input") as f:
    input_data = f.read()
"""

Next, we need to parse the input data to extract the heights of the trees. Since the heights are represented as single digits, we can simply split the input string on the newline character to get a list of strings, each of which represents the heights of the trees in a single row. We can then convert each of these strings to a list of integers, using the `int()` function, to get a two-dimensional list of tree heights.

Once we have the list of tree heights, we can use a nested loop to iterate over each tree in the grid, and count the number of trees that are visible from that tree in each direction (up, down, left, right). To determine if a tree is visible, we simply need to check if there are any taller trees between it and the edge of the grid in that direction.

The following code implements these steps and outputs the answer:
