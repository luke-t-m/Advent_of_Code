"""The first thing we need to do is read the input from the file `8_input`. The easiest way to do this is using the `with` statement and the `open` function. This will open the file, read its contents, and then close it automatically when we're done.

We can then read the contents of the file into a list of strings, where each string represents a row in the grid. We can do this using a `for` loop and the `readline` method on the file object.

Next, we need to count the number of visible trees. We can do this by looping over each row and column in the grid, and checking if there are any trees of height greater than 0. If there are, we increment a counter variable.

Finally, we need to print the answer. We can do this using the `print` function.

Here's the complete solution:

"""
with open('8_input') as f:
    rows = []
    for line in f:
        rows.append(line.strip())

count = 0
for row in rows:
    # Count the number of trees in this row.
    count += sum(1 for c in row if c != '0')

# Print the answer.
print(count)
