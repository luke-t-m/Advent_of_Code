"""To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the rows and columns of the input grid. For each row and column, we need to find the highest tree in that row or column. If the highest tree is visible (i.e., there are no other trees in that row or column that are taller), then we increment the count of visible trees.

Here's one way to implement this in Python:

"""
# Read the input grid from the file
with open("8_input") as f:
    grid = [list(map(int, line.strip())) for line in f]

# The number of visible trees
visible_trees = 0

# The number of rows and columns in the grid
rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

# Iterate over the rows and columns of the grid
for row in range(rows):
    for col in range(cols):
        # Find the highest tree in the current row
        max_row = max(grid[row])
        # If the current tree is the highest in its row,
        # and there are no taller trees in its column,
        # then it is visible, so increment the count
        if grid[row][col] == max_row and max(grid[i][col] for i in range(rows)) == max_row:
            visible_trees += 1

# Print the number of visible trees
print(visible_trees)
