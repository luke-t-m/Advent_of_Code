"""First, we need to read the input from the file called "8_input". We can do this by opening the file and reading its contents. Then, we can split the input by newlines to get a list of rows.

Next, we can iterate over the rows and columns of the grid, and count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid. To do this, we can keep track of the maximum height of the trees in each row and column. Then, for each tree, we can check if it is the tallest tree in its row and column. If it is, we can increment the count of visible trees.

Finally, we can print the count of visible trees.

Here is some sample code that solves the problem:

"""
# Open the input file and read its contents
with open('8_input') as f:
    input = f.read()

# Split the input by newlines to get a list of rows

max_row_heights = [0] * len(rows)
max_col_heights = [0] * len(rows[0])

# Iterate over the rows and columns of the grid
for i in range(len(rows)):
    for j in range(len(rows[0])):
        # Get the height of the current tree
        height = int(rows[i][j])

        # Update the maximum height of trees in the current row and column
        max_row_heights[i] = max(max_row_heights[i], height)
        max_col_heights[j] = max(max_col_heights[j], height)

# Keep track of the count of visible trees
visible_tree_count = 0

# Iterate over the rows and columns of the grid again
for i in range(len(rows)):
    for j in range(len(rows[0])):

# Print the count of visible trees
print(visible_tree_count)
