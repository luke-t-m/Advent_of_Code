"""To solve this problem, we need to define a function that takes in the height of each tree as input and returns the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid. We can do this by iterating over each tree in the grid and checking if it is visible from any direction.

The first step is to read in the input from the file `8_input`. We can do this using the `open()` and `readlines()` functions:

"""
with open('8_input', 'r') as f:
    heights = f.readlines()
"""

Next, we need to parse the input so that each tree height is stored as an integer in a list. We can do this using a `for` loop and the `strip()` and `int()` functions:

"""
heights = []

for line in heights:
    heights.append([int(x) for x in line.strip()])
"""

Now that we have the heights of each tree as a list of lists, we can define a function to count the number of visible trees. This function should take in the `heights` as an argument and return the number of visible trees.

To implement this function, we can iterate over each tree in the grid and check if it is visible from any direction. If it is, we can increment a counter variable. We can do this using a nested `for` loop:

"""
def count_visible_trees(heights):
    # Initialize counter
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each tree in the grid
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        for j in range(len(heights[i])):
            # Check if tree is visible from any direction
            if is_tree_visible(heights, i, j):
                # Increment counter if tree is visible
                count += 1
    
    # Return number of visible trees
    return count
"""

Next, we need to define the `is_tree_visible()` function, which takes in the `heights`, the `i` and `j` indices of a tree, and returns `True` if the tree is visible from any direction, and `False` otherwise.

To implement this function, we can check if the tree is visible from the left, right, top, or bottom. If it is visible from any of these directions, we can return `True`. Otherwise, we can return `False`.

To check if a tree is visible from the left, we can iterate over each tree to the left of it and check if there are any taller trees. If there are not, then the tree is visible from the left. We can do this using a `for` loop and the `max()` function:

"""
def is_tree_visible(heights, i, j):
    # Check if tree is visible from the left
    for k in range(j):
        if max(heights[i][:j]) > heights[i][j]:
            return False
    # Tree is visible from the left, so return True
    return True
"""

We can do the same thing to check if the tree is visible from the right, top, or bottom. We just need to iterate over the appropriate range of indices and check if there are any taller trees. If there are not, then the tree is visible from that direction.

Here is the complete implementation of the `count_"""
