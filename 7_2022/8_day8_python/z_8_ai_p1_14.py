This is a solution to the problem in Python. It reads the input from a file called `8_input` and counts the number of visible trees on the edge of the grid and in the interior. To do this, it checks the height of each tree in the grid and only counts trees that are of height 5. It then checks for visibility in each direction by iterating over the rows or columns in that direction and checking if any tree is taller than the tree being considered. If a tree is not visible from any direction, it is not counted. Finally, the solution prints the total number of visible trees."""
