"""To solve this problem, we will need to read the input from the file `8_input`, which contains a grid of digits representing the heights of trees in a forest. We will then need to count the number of trees that are visible from the outside of the grid by looking directly along a row or column.

Here is a solution in Python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the grid of tree heights
with open("8_input") as f:
    grid = [list(line.strip()) for line in f]

# Count the number of trees that are visible from the outside of the grid
count = 0
for row in range(len(grid)):
    for col in range(len(grid[0])):
        # Check if the tree at (row, col) is visible from the left
        if col == 0 or int(grid[row][col]) > int(grid[row][col-1]):
            count += 1

        # Check if the tree at (row, col) is visible from the top
        if row == 0 or int(grid[row][col]) > int(grid[row-1][col]):
            count += 1

# Print the number of visible trees
print(count)
"""

This solution reads the grid of tree heights from the input file and then loops through each tree in the grid. For each tree, it checks if the tree is visible from the left or top by comparing its height to the heights of adjacent trees. If a tree is visible from the left or top, the count of visible trees is incremented. Finally, the solution prints the total number of visible trees."""
