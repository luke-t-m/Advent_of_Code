"""The problem requires that we count the number of trees that are visible from the outside of a grid. To solve this problem, we can first read in the grid from the input file, and then iterate over the grid and count the number of trees that are visible.

Here is one way to solve this problem in Python:

"""
# Read in the grid from the input file
with open('8_input') as f:
    grid = [[int(c) for c in line.strip()] for line in f]

# Initialize a counter for the number of visible trees
num_visible_trees = 0

# Iterate over the grid and count the number of visible trees
for row in grid:
    # Iterate over each element in the row
    for i, tree in enumerate(row):
        # Check if the current tree is visible
        if tree > max(row[:i] + row[i+1:]):
            # If it is, increment the counter
            num_visible_trees += 1

# Print the result
print(num_visible_trees)
"""

This solution will read in the grid from the input file, and then iterate over each row and element in the row. For each element, it will check if the current tree is taller than all of the other trees in the row, and if it is, it will increment the counter for the number of visible trees. At the end, it will print the result.

Note that this solution only considers trees in the same row or column as the current tree, as specified in the problem statement. It does not consider trees that are diagonally adjacent to the current tree."""
