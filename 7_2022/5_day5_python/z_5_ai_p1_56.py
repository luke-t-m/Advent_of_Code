"""To solve this problem, we will need to simulate the rearrangement procedure given in the input. We can do this by storing the stacks in a list of lists, where each inner list represents a stack of crates. Then, for each step in the rearrangement procedure, we will remove the specified number of crates from the source stack, and insert them at the top of the destination stack.

Here is one way to implement this in Python:

"""
# read the input from the file
with open('5_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# initialize the stacks of crates
stacks = [[c for c in line.strip()] for line in lines[:3]]

# simulate the rearrangement procedure
for line in lines[3:]:
    # parse the input
    src, _, dest, _, num = line.split()
    num = int(num)

    # remove the specified number of crates from the source stack
    crates = stacks[int(src) - 1][-num:]
    stacks[int(src) - 1] = stacks[int(src) - 1][:-num]

    # insert the crates at the top of the destination stack
    stacks[int(dest) - 1] += crates

# print the top crate from each stack
print(''.join(stacks[i][-1] for i in range(3)))
"""

We can then save this code to a file called `solution.py` and run it using the following command:

"""
python solution.py
"""

This should print the top crate from each stack after the rearrangement procedure is complete, which is the answer to the problem."""
