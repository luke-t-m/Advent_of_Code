"""First, we need to read the input from a file called `5_input`. We can do this using the `open` function, which takes the file name as its first argument and the mode in which to open the file as its second argument. In this case, we want to open the file in read mode, which is represented by the string `'r'`. This will return a file object that we can use to read the input.

Next, we need to parse the input and extract the starting configuration of the stacks and the rearrangement procedure. The starting configuration is given in the first few lines of the input, with each line representing a stack and each character representing a crate. The rearrangement procedure is given in the remaining lines of the input, with each line representing a step in the procedure.

To parse the input, we can read the lines of the file one at a time and use string methods such as `split` and `strip` to extract the relevant information from each line. For example, we can split each line of the rearrangement procedure on the space character to extract the number of crates to move and the source and destination stacks.

Once we have parsed the input, we can apply the rearrangement procedure to the starting configuration of the stacks to determine the final configuration. To do this, we can use a list of lists to represent the stacks, with each sublist representing a stack and containing the crates in that stack. We can then move crates between the stacks by modifying the sublists accordingly.

Finally, we can print the top crate of each stack by accessing the last element of each sublist.

Here is one possible implementation of the solution in Python:

"""
# Open the input file in read mode
with open('5_input', 'r') as f:
    # Read the lines of the file
    lines = f.readlines()

# Initialize a list to represent the stacks
stacks = []

# Parse the starting configuration of the stacks
for line in lines[:3]:
    # Strip whitespace from the line and split it into a list of characters
    crates = line.strip().split()
    # Append the list of crates to the list of stacks
    stacks.append(crates)

# Parse the rearrangement procedure
for line in lines[3:]:
    # Split the line on the space character to extract the number of crates
    # to move and the source and destination stacks
    n, source, _, _, _, destination = line.split()
    # Convert the number of crates and the source and destination stack indices
    # to integers
    n = int(n)
    source = int(source[0]) - 1
    destination = int(destination[0]) - 1

    # Move the specified number of crates from the source stack to the
    # destination stack
    moved_crates = stacks[source][-n:]
    stacks[destination].extend(moved_crates)
    stacks[source] = stacks[source][:-n]

# Print the top crate of each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1], end='')
