"""To solve this problem, we first need to create a representation of the starting state of the stacks and then simulate the rearrangement procedure step by step until it completes. Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input') as f:
  stacks = [list(line.strip()) for line in f]

# Reverse the stacks so that the top crates are at the end of the lists
stacks = [stack[::-1] for stack in stacks]

# Read and apply the rearrangement procedure
with open('5_input') as f:
  for line in f:
    if line.startswith('move'):
      # Parse the step
      a, _, _, _, b, _, _ = line.split()
      a, b = int(a), int(b)
      
      # Move the top crate from stack a to stack b
      crate = stacks[a - 1].pop()
      stacks[b - 1].append(crate)

# Print the top crates of each stack
result = ''.join(stack[-1] for stack in stacks)
print(result)
"""

Here, we first read the input from the file and reverse the stacks so that the top crates are at the end of the lists. Then, we read and apply the rearrangement procedure step by step, moving the top crate from one stack to another. Finally, we print the top crates of each stack to get the result."""
