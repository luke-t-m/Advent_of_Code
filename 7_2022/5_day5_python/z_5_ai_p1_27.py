"""To solve this problem, we can create a list of stacks that represent the starting state of the stacks. Then, we can iterate through the instructions, moving crates from one stack to another as specified. After we have applied all of the instructions, we can simply return the top crate from each stack.

Here is one possible implementation of this approach in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open("5_input") as f:
    input = f.read().strip()

# Split the input into lines
lines = input.split("\n")

# Create the list of stacks
stacks = []
for line in lines:
    # Parse the line as a list of integers, and append it to the list of stacks
    stacks.append([int(x) for x in line.split()])

# Apply the instructions
for line in lines[3:]:
    # Split the line into its parts
    parts = line.split()

    # Parse the parts as integers
    num_crates = int(parts[0])
    from_stack = int(parts[3])
    to_stack = int(parts[5])

    # Move the crates from the "from" stack to the "to" stack
    crates = stacks[from_stack - 1][-num_crates:]
    stacks[from_stack - 1] = stacks[from_stack - 1][:-num_crates]
    stacks[to_stack - 1].extend(crates)

# Print the top crate from each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1])
"""

When run on the example input, this code will print `CMZ`, which is the correct solution to the problem."""
