"""The following python code will solve the problem correctly by reading the input from the file "5_input" and printing the answer:

"""
# read input from file
with open("5_input", "r") as file:

    input = file.readlines()

# initialize empty list for stacks
stacks = []

# for each line in the input
for line in input:

    line = line.strip()

    # if the line is not empty
