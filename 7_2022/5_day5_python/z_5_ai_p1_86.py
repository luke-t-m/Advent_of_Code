"""To solve this problem, we will need to simulate the steps of the rearrangement procedure given in the input. To do this, we can use a list of lists to represent the stacks of crates. Each inner list will represent a stack, and the elements of the inner list will be the crates in that stack.

First, we will need to read the input from the file "5_input". We can do this using the `open()` and `readlines()` functions. Then, we can use the `strip()` method to remove the newline character from the end of each line.

Next, we will need to parse the input to extract the starting configuration of the stacks and the rearrangement procedure. We can do this by iterating over the lines of the input and using regular expressions to match the relevant information.

Once we have parsed the input, we can simulate the rearrangement procedure by iterating over the steps and using the `pop()` and `insert()` methods to move the crates between the stacks.

Finally, we can combine the top crates of each stack into a single string and print the result.

Here is a complete implementation of this solution in Python:

"""
import re

# read input from file
with open("5_input") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# remove newline characters from input
lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]

# parse input
stack_pattern = re.compile(r"\[([A-Z]*)\]")
start_pattern = re.compile(r"^\d+:")
move_pattern = re.compile(r"^move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)$")

stacks = []
for line in lines:
    match = stack_pattern.match(line)
    if match:
        # extract crates from stack
        crates = list(match.group(1))
        stacks.append(crates)
    else:
        start_match = start_pattern.match(line)
        if start_match:
            # starting configuration of stacks
            pass
        else:
            # rearrangement procedure
            move_match = move_pattern.match(line)
            if move_match:
                # extract details of move
                num_crates = int(move_match.group(1))
                from_stack = int(move_match.group(2))
                to_stack = int(move_match.group(3))

                # move crates between stacks
                for i in range(num_crates):
                    crate = stacks[from_stack - 1].pop()
                    stacks[to_stack - 1].insert(0, crate)

# combine top crates of each stack into a single string
result = "".join([stacks[i][-1] for i in range(len(stacks))])

# print result
print(result)
"""

We can test this implementation by running it on the example input given in the problem description. The expected output is `CMZ`.

To run this code, save it to a file called `5_solution.py` and run it using the `python` command. For example:

"""
python 5_solution.py
"""

This should print the result `CMZ` to the console."""
