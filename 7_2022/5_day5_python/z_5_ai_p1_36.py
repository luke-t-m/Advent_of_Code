"""Here is a possible solution to the problem in Python:

"""
# Read input from the file 5_input
with open("5_input") as f:
    lines = f.read().strip().split("\n")

# Create a list of lists to represent the stacks of crates
stacks = [list(line) for line in lines]

# Loop through the rearrangement instructions
for line in lines[3:]:
    # Parse the instruction
    from_stack, to_stack = [int(x) for x in line.split()[1:3]]

    # Move the top crate from one stack to the other
    crate = stacks[from_stack - 1].pop()
    stacks[to_stack - 1].append(crate)

# Print the top crate from each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1], end="")
"""

This solution reads the input from the file `5_input`, parses the input to create a list of stacks, and then loops through the rearrangement instructions to move the crates between stacks. Finally, it prints the top crate from each stack."""
