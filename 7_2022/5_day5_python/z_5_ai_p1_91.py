"""There is no information in the prompt about the content of the input file. In order to write code to solve this problem, we must first understand what the problem is asking us to do.

The problem describes a series of steps in which crates are moved between stacks. At the end of the procedure, the Elves want to know which crate ends up on top of each stack.

To solve this problem, we can create a list of stacks, where each stack is represented as a list of crates. We can then simulate the rearrangement procedure by iterating over the steps and moving the crates between the stacks. After all the steps have been completed, we can print the top crates of each stack.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how we might implement this solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input', 'r') as f:
    steps = [line.strip() for line in f]

# Initialize the stacks
stacks = [['Z', 'N'], ['M', 'C', 'D'], ['P']]

# Simulate the rearrangement procedure
for step in steps:
    # Parse the step
    words = step.split()
    quantity = int(words[1])
    from_stack = int(words[3])
    to_stack = int(words[5])

    # Move the crates
    for _ in range(quantity):
        crate = stacks[from_stack - 1].pop()
        stacks[to_stack - 1].append(crate)

# Print the top crates of each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1], end='')
"""

This code assumes that the input file contains the steps of the rearrangement procedure, one per line. It also assumes that the initial configuration of the stacks is as shown in the example in the prompt. You may need to modify the code to handle different inputs.

Once you have written and tested your code, you can print the answer by running the code and printing the output. For example, you could run the code like this:

"""
"""

where `solution.py` is the name of your Python script. The output of the code will be the answer to the problem."""
