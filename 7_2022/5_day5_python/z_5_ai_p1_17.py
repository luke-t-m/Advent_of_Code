"""To solve this problem, we need to simulate the crate rearrangement procedure. We can do this using a simple Python program.

First, we need to read the input from the file. We can do this using the `open()` function and the `readlines()` method. This will return a list of strings, each of which represents a line of the input.

Next, we need to parse the input to determine the initial configuration of the stacks and the rearrangement procedure. We can do this by looping over the lines of the input and using regular expressions to extract the relevant information.

Once we have the initial configuration and the rearrangement procedure, we can simulate the procedure by performing the necessary operations on the stacks.

Finally, we can print the top crate of each stack to obtain the solution to the problem.

Here is an implementation of this solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Parse the input to determine the initial configuration and rearrangement procedure
initial_configuration = []
rearrangement_procedure = []
for line in lines:
    # Extract the stack numbers and crate names from the input
    stack_numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', line)
    crates = re.findall(r'\[(\w+)\]', line)
    
    # If stack numbers are present, this is the initial configuration
    if stack_numbers:
        initial_configuration = crates
    # If no stack numbers are present, this is a rearrangement step
    else:
        rearrangement_procedure.append(crates)

# Simulate the rearrangement procedure
stacks = initial_configuration
for step in rearrangement_procedure:
    # Perform the necessary operation on the stacks
    from_stack = int(step[0]) - 1
    to_stack = int(step[2]) - 1
    crate = stacks[from_stack].pop()
    stacks[to_stack].append(crate)

# Print the top crate of each stack
for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
    print(f'The top crate of stack {i+1} is {stack[-1]}')
