"""To solve this problem, we first need to read the input from the file `5_input`. We can do this using the built-in `open` function to open the file, and then using the `readlines` method to read all the lines from the file into a list.

Next, we need to process the input to determine which crates end up on top of each stack after the rearrangement procedure is complete. We can do this by iterating through each line of the input and performing the indicated crate-moving operations.

Finally, we need to print the resulting top crates of each stack. We can do this by concatenating the top crates of each stack and printing the result.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input') as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

# Initialize the stacks
stacks = [[], [], []]

# Iterate through each line of the input
for line in lines:
  # Parse the line to determine which stack to move from and which stack to move to
  from_stack, to_stack = map(int, line.split()[-2:])

  # Move the top crate from the "from" stack to the "to" stack
  stacks[to_stack - 1].append(stacks[from_stack - 1].pop())

# Concatenate the top crates of each stack and print the result
print(''.join([stacks[i][-1] for i in range(len(stacks))]))
"""

Note that in this solution, we are assuming that the top crates of each stack are represented by single letters (e.g. 'Z' for the top crate of stack 3 in the example above). If this is not the case, we may need to adjust the solution accordingly."""
