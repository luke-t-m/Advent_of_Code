"""To solve this problem, we will need to implement a simple simulation of the rearrangement procedure described in the problem statement. We can do this by creating a list of stacks, and then simulating the movement of crates from one stack to another in each step of the procedure.

First, we will need to read the input from the file `5_input`. We can do this using the `open()` and `readlines()` functions. The `readlines()` function will read all of the lines in the file as a list of strings, which we can then iterate over to parse the input.

Once we have parsed the input, we can create a list of stacks. Each stack is represented as a list of crates, with the top crate being the last element in the list. We can initialize the stacks by adding a list for each stack, with each list containing the crates in that stack from bottom to top.

Next, we will need to implement the rearrangement procedure. In each step of the procedure, we need to move a specified number of crates from one stack to another. To do this, we can use the `pop()` method to remove the desired number of crates from the source stack, and the `append()` method to add them to the destination stack.

After we have simulated the entire procedure, we can use the `join()` method to combine the top crates from each stack into a single string, which we can then print as the answer.

Here is one possible implementation of this solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Parse the input
stacks = []
for line in lines:
    # Split the line into a list of crates
    crates = line.strip().split()
    # Add a list for each stack, with the crates in that stack
    # from bottom to top
    stacks.append(crates[::-1])

# Simulate the rearrangement procedure
for line in lines[len(stacks):]:
    # Split the line into tokens
    tokens = line.strip().split()
    # Parse the source and destination stacks and the number of crates
    src = int(tokens[1]) - 1
    dst = int(tokens[3]) - 1
    num = int(tokens[5])
    # Move the specified number of crates from the source stack to the
    # destination stack
    for i in range(num):
        crates = stacks[src].pop()
        stacks[dst].append(crates)

# Print the top crate from each stack
print(''.join(stacks[i][-1] for i in range(len(stacks))))
