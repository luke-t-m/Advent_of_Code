"""To solve this problem, you can use the following python code:

"""
# Open the input file and read the lines
with open("5_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Create a list of stacks
stacks = []

# Parse the input
for line in lines:
    # Each stack is represented by a string of characters
    stack = ""
    # Split the line by spaces
    parts = line.split()
    # The last part is the stack number
    stack_number = parts[-1]
    # The rest of the parts are the crates in the stack
    crates = parts[:-1]
    # Add the crates to the stack string
    for crate in crates:
        stack += crate
    # Add the stack to the list of stacks
    stacks.append((stack_number, stack))

# Sort the stacks by their number
stacks.sort()

# Print the top crate of each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[1][0])
"""

The code first reads the input from the file and parses it into a list of stacks. Each stack is represented by a tuple containing the stack number and a string of characters representing the crates in the stack. The stacks are then sorted by their number. Finally, the code prints the top crate of each stack."""
