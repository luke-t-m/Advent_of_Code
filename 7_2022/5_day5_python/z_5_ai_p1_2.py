"""To solve this problem, we need to keep track of which crates are on top of each stack and update their positions as the rearrangement procedure is applied. We can represent the stacks as a list of lists, where each sublist contains the crates on a given stack.

Here is a solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open("5_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Parse the input into a list of lists representing the stacks
stacks = [[crate for crate in line.strip()] for line in lines[:3]]

# Parse the rearrangement instructions
instructions = [line.strip().split() for line in lines[3:]]

# Apply the instructions
for instruction in instructions:
    # Parse the instruction
    num_crates = int(instruction[0])
    from_stack = int(instruction[3]) - 1
    to_stack = int(instruction[5]) - 1

    # Move the crates from the from_stack to the to_stack
    crates = stacks[from_stack][:num_crates]
    stacks[from_stack] = stacks[from_stack][num_crates:]
    stacks[to_stack] = crates + stacks[to_stack]

# Print the top crate on each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1])
"""

Note that the above solution assumes that the input is formatted exactly as in the example given in the problem description (i.e. the first three lines contain the initial arrangement of crates, followed by a series of instructions). You may need to modify the solution slightly if the input is not in this exact format."""
