"""The problem description suggests that we will receive a list of instructions, and we will need to apply those instructions to the list of stacks of crates. After we apply all the instructions, we will need to print the top crate in each stack.

To solve this problem, we can first create a function that takes a list of stacks of crates and an instruction as input, and returns the modified list of stacks of crates. We can then apply all the instructions to the list of stacks of crates, and finally print the top crates of each stack.

Here is one possible implementation in Python:

"""
def apply_instruction(stacks, instruction):
    # Parse the instruction to get the source and destination stack numbers
    src, _, dest, _, _ = instruction.split()
    src, dest = int(src), int(dest)

    # Move the top crate from the source stack to the destination stack
    crate = stacks[src-1].pop()
    stacks[dest-1].append(crate)

    return stacks

# Read the list of stacks of crates from the input file
with open('5_input') as f:
    stacks = [[c for c in stack.strip()] for stack in f.readlines()]

# Read the list of instructions from the input file
with open('5_input') as f:
    instructions = f.readlines()

# Apply all the instructions to the list of stacks of crates
for instruction in instructions:
    stacks = apply_instruction(stacks, instruction)

# Print the top crate of each stack
for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
    print(f"Stack {i+1}: {stack[-1]}")
"""

Note that this solution assumes that the input file has the following format:
- The first line of the file contains a drawing of the starting stacks of crates, with each stack on a separate line.
- The remaining lines of the file contain the rearrangement instructions, with each instruction on a separate line.

For example, the input file for the example in the problem description would look like this:
"""
[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
"""

If the input file has a different format, the solution may need to be modified accordingly."""
