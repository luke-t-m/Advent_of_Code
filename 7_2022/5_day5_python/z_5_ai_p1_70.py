"""To solve this problem, you need to create a program that reads the initial configuration of the stacks and the rearrangement instructions from a file, applies the instructions to the stacks, and then outputs the final crate on top of each stack.

Here is an example solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Parse the initial configuration of the stacks
stack1 = list(lines[0].strip())
stack2 = list(lines[1].strip())
stack3 = list(lines[2].strip())

# Parse the rearrangement instructions
instructions = lines[3:]

# Apply the instructions to the stacks
for instruction in instructions:
    # Parse the instruction
    parts = instruction.strip().split()
    n = int(parts[1])
    from_stack = int(parts[3])
    to_stack = int(parts[5])

    # Move the top n crates from the from_stack to the to_stack
    crates = []
    for i in range(n):
        crates.append(eval(f"stack{from_stack}.pop()"))
    for crate in reversed(crates):
        eval(f"stack{to_stack}.append(crate)")

# Print the final crate on top of each stack
print(stack1[-1])
print(stack2[-1])
print(stack3[-1])
"""

You can save this code to a file called `solution.py`, and then run it using the following command:

"""
python solution.py
"""

This will read the input from the file `5_input`, apply the rearrangement instructions to the stacks, and then print the final crate on top of each stack."""
