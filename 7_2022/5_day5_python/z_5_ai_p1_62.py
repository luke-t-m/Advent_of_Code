"""The problem statement describes a sequence of operations that are performed on stacks of crates. The problem asks us to find the top crate in each stack after the sequence of operations is performed. We can solve this problem by representing the stacks as lists in Python and using the information provided in the problem statement to perform the operations on the stacks.

First, we need to read the input from the file `5_input`. This can be done using the `open()` and `readlines()` functions in Python.

"""
# Open the file and read the input lines
with open('5_input') as file:
    input_lines = file.readlines()
"""

Next, we need to parse the input and initialize the stacks. The input consists of the initial configuration of the stacks and the sequence of operations that need to be performed. We can initialize the stacks by splitting each line of the input on whitespace and creating a list of crates for each stack.

"""
# Initialize the stacks
stacks = []
for line in input_lines[:3]:
    crates = line.strip().split()
    stacks.append(crates)
"""

Now that we have initialized the stacks, we can perform the sequence of operations on them. The operations are given as a list of strings in the input. We can use a `for` loop to iterate over these strings and apply the operations to the stacks.

"""
# Perform the operations
for operation in input_lines[3:]:
    # Parse the operation
    from_stack, _, _, to_stack = operation.split()
    from_stack = int(from_stack) - 1
    to_stack = int(to_stack) - 1
    
    # Perform the operation
    crates = stacks[from_stack].pop()
    stacks[to_stack].append(crates)
"""

After performing the operations, the top crate in each stack can be found by taking the last element of the list representing the stack. We can use a `for` loop to iterate over the stacks and print the top crate in each stack.

"""
# Print the top crate in each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1])
"""

Putting everything together, we get the following solution:

"""
# Open the file and read the input lines
with open('5_input') as file:
    input_lines = file.readlines()

# Initialize the stacks
stacks = []
for line in input_lines[:3]:
    crates = line.strip().split()
    stacks.append(crates)

# Perform the operations
for operation in input_lines[3:]:
    # Parse the operation
    from_stack, _, _, to_stack = operation.split()
    from_stack = int(from_stack) - 1
    to_stack = int(to_stack) - 1
    
    # Perform the operation
    crates = stacks[from_stack].pop()
    stacks[to_stack].append(crates)

# Print the top crate in each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1])
