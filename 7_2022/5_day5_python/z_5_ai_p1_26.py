"""To solve this problem, we will simulate the rearrangement procedure by following the instructions given in the input file. We will need to store the initial configuration of the stacks, and apply the instructions one by one to produce the final configuration of the stacks.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Read the initial configuration of the stacks from the input file
with open('5_input') as f:
    stacks = [[c for c in line.strip()] for line in f]

# Read the rearrangement instructions from the input file
with open('5_input') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.startswith('move'):
            # Parse the instruction
            _, n, f, _, t = line.split()
            n = int(n)
            f = int(f[0])
            t = int(t[0])

            # Move n crates from stack f to stack t
            crates = stacks[f][-n:]
            stacks[f] = stacks[f][:-n]
            stacks[t].extend(crates)

# Print the top crate of each stack
print(''.join(stacks[i][-1] for i in range(1, len(stacks)+1)))
"""

Note that this solution assumes that the input file is in the correct format, with the initial configuration of the stacks followed by the rearrangement instructions. It also assumes that the instructions are valid, i.e. they specify a valid number of crates to move and valid source and destination stacks. If the input is not in the correct format or contains invalid instructions, this code may produce unexpected results."""
