"""To solve this problem in python, you will need to create a function that takes the starting positions of the stacks of crates as input, and the rearrangement procedure, and outputs the crate that ends up on top of each stack.

Here is an example solution in python:

"""
# define the function
def solve(stacks, procedure):
  # create a list to store the top crates of each stack
  top_crates = []
  # loop through each step in the procedure
  for step in procedure:
    # split the step into the source and destination stacks
    source, destination = step.split("from")
    # get the top crate from the source stack
    top_crate = stacks[source]
    # remove the top crate from the source stack
    stacks[source] = stacks[source][1:]
    # add the top crate to the destination stack
    stacks[destination] = [top_crate] + stacks[destination]
  # loop through each stack and get the top crate
  for stack in stacks:
    top_crates.append(stacks[stack][0])
  # return the list of top crates
  return top_crates

# read the input from the file
with open("5_input") as file:
  # store the input as a list of lines
  input = file.read().splitlines()

# create a dictionary to store the stacks of crates
stacks = {
  # the first stack is stack 1
  1: input[0],
  # the second stack is stack 2
  2: input[1],
  # the third stack is stack 3
  3: input[2]
}

# create a list of the rearrangement procedure
procedure = input[3:]

# solve the problem and print the answer
print(solve(stacks, procedure))
"""

To use this solution, you will need to save it to a file called "solution.py", and then run it using the following command:

"""
python solution.py
"""

This will read the input from the file "5_input", solve the problem, and print the answer to the console."""
