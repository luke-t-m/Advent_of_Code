"""The input is not provided in the prompt, so we will assume that the input is in the file `5_input`.

We can solve this problem by simulating the rearrangement procedure. To do so, we will maintain a list of stacks, where each stack is represented as a list of crates. We will then simulate each step of the rearrangement procedure by moving crates from one stack to another.

Here is a solution in Python:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open("5_input") as f:
    lines = f.read().strip().split("\n")

# Parse the input
stacks = [list(line) for line in lines[:-1]]
steps = [tuple(line.split()) for line in lines[-1:]]

# Simulate the rearrangement procedure
for step in steps:
    # Unpack the step
    n, from_stack, _, _, to_stack = step

    # Move the crates from one stack to another
    crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(n):]
    stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(n)]
    stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(crates)

# Print the top crate of each stack
print("".join(stack[-1] for stack in stacks))
"""

To run the code, save it to a file (e.g. `solution.py`) and run it using the `python` command. For example:

"""
python solution.py
"""

This will print the top crate of each stack after the rearrangement procedure is complete."""
