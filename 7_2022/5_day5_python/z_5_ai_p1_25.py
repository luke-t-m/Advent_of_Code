"""The problem is to simulate a sequence of moves of crates from one stack to another. The initial configuration of the stacks of crates is given, and the sequence of moves is also given. The task is to find out which crate is on the top of each stack after the sequence of moves is completed.

To solve this problem, we can keep track of the stacks of crates using a list of lists. Each inner list will represent a stack of crates, with the topmost crate at the end of the list. When a crate is moved from one stack to another, we can simply remove the crate from the top of the source stack and append it to the top of the destination stack.

Here is a solution to the problem in Python:

"""
# Read the initial configuration of the stacks of crates
stacks = []
with open("5_input") as f:
    for line in f:
        stack = [crate for crate in line.strip()]
        stacks.append(stack)

# Read the sequence of moves and simulate them
with open("5_input") as f:
    for line in f:
        # Split the line into tokens
        tokens = line.strip().split()
        
        # Skip lines that don't contain a move
        if len(tokens) != 5:
            continue
        
        # Parse the move
        num_crates = int(tokens[0])
        src_stack = int(tokens[3]) - 1
        dest_stack = int(tokens[5]) - 1
        
        # Perform the move
        for _ in range(num_crates):
            crate = stacks[src_stack].pop()
            stacks[dest_stack].append(crate)

# Print the top crate of each stack
for stack in stacks:
    print(stack[-1], end="")
print()
"""

After the sequence of moves is completed, the top crate of each stack can be found by printing the last element of each inner list."""
