"""There is no problem description or any code provided in the prompt. I can only assume that the problem is asking the user to create a program that takes in a list of instructions for moving crates and outputs the crate on top of each stack after the instructions have been executed.

Here is an example of how this program could be implemented in Python:

"""
# Read in the list of instructions from the input file
with open("5_input", "r") as f:
    instructions = f.readlines()

# Parse the instructions and create a list of stack states
stacks = [[], [], []]
for instruction in instructions:
    move_instruction = instruction.split()
    num_crates = int(move_instruction[0])
    from_stack = int(move_instruction[1])
    to_stack = int(move_instruction[2])
    
    # Move the specified number of crates from the "from" stack to the "to" stack
    crates = stacks[from_stack - 1][-num_crates:]
    stacks[from_stack - 1] = stacks[from_stack - 1][:-num_crates]
    stacks[to_stack - 1] += crates

# Print the crate on top of each stack
print("".join([stacks[i][-1] for i in range(len(stacks))]))
