"""This problem can be solved in a number of ways, but the most straightforward solution involves representing the stacks as lists in python, and then simulating the sequence of steps given in the problem description to determine the final state of the stacks.

Here is one way to solve this problem in python:

"""
# First, we initialize the stacks as empty lists
stack1 = []
stack2 = []
stack3 = []

# Next, we read the starting configuration of the stacks from the input file
with open('5_input') as f:
    # We iterate over each line in the file
    for line in f:
        # We split the line by whitespace to extract the individual crates
        crates = line.split()
        # We append each crate to the appropriate stack
        for crate in crates:
            if crate[0] == '1':
                stack1.append(crate[1])
            elif crate[0] == '2':
                stack2.append(crate[1])
            elif crate[0] == '3':
                stack3.append(crate[1])

# Now that we have initialized the stacks, we can simulate the sequence of steps
# to determine the final state of the stacks

# First, we read the sequence of steps from the input file
with open('5_input') as f:
    # We iterate over each line in the file
    for line in f:
        # We split the line by whitespace to extract the individual steps
        steps = line.split()
        # We iterate over each step in the sequence
        for step in steps:
            # We extract the source and destination stacks from the step
            source = int(step.split('from')[1].split('to')[0])
            dest = int(step.split('to')[1])
            # We move the top crate from the source stack to the destination stack
            if source == 1:
                crate = stack1.pop()
                if dest == 1:
                    stack1.append(crate)
                elif dest == 2:
                    stack2.append(crate)
                elif dest == 3:
                    stack3.append(crate)
            elif source == 2:
                crate = stack2.pop()
                if dest == 1:
                    stack1.append(crate)
                elif dest == 2:
                    stack2.append(crate)
                elif dest == 3:
                    stack3.append(crate)
            elif source == 3:
                crate = stack3.pop()
                if dest == 1:
                    stack1.append(crate)
                elif dest == 2:
                    stack2.append(crate)
                elif dest == 3:
                    stack3.append(crate)

# Once the sequence of steps is complete, we can determine the top crate in each stack
# by looking at the last element in each list
print(stack1[-1] + stack2[-1] + stack3[-1])
"""

Note that this solution assumes that the input is formatted as specified in the problem description, with the initial configuration of the stacks on the first line, followed by the sequence of steps on subsequent lines. It also assumes that the input is stored in a file called `5_input`."""
