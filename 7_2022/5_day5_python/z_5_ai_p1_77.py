"""To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of crates according to the instructions given in the problem statement. We can do this by using a list of lists to represent the stacks of crates, where each inner list represents a stack and contains the crates in that stack.

To move a crate from one stack to another, we can use the `pop()` and `insert()` methods on the list to remove the crate from the source stack and insert it into the destination stack. We can then use the `index()` method on the list to find the top crate on each stack at the end of the rearrangement procedure.

Here is one possible solution:

"""
# Read the input from the file "5_input"
with open("5_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Split the input into the initial configuration of the stacks and the list of moves
config_lines = lines[:3]
moves = lines[3:]

# Parse the initial configuration of the stacks
stacks = []
for line in config_lines:
    # Remove the leading and trailing square brackets and split the line into a list of crates
    stack = line.strip().strip("[]").split()
    stacks.append(stack)

# Simulate the movement of crates according to the list of moves
for move in moves:
    # Parse the move into its source and destination stacks and the number of crates to move
    src, dest, num_crates = move.split()
    num_crates = int(num_crates)
    src = int(src[1]) - 1
    dest = int(dest[1]) - 1
    
    # Move the crates one at a time from the source stack to the destination stack
    for _ in range(num_crates):
        crate = stacks[src].pop()
        stacks[dest].insert(0, crate)

# Print the top crate on each stack
for i, stack in enumerate(stacks):
    print(f"Top crate on stack {i + 1}: {stack[0]}")
"""

Note that this solution assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors or invalid moves. It also does not include any error-checking or input validation."""
