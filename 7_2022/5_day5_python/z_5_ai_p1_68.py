"""The first step is to read the input from the file `5_input`. To do this in Python, we can use the `open()` function to open the file, then call `readlines()` to read the lines of the file into a list. We can then iterate over this list and use the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

Next, we need to parse the input to extract the starting state of the stacks and the rearrangement procedure. We can do this by splitting each line on the space character, then converting the resulting strings to integers where necessary.

Once we have the starting state and the procedure, we can apply the procedure to the stacks to find the final state. We can do this by iterating over the procedure and performing the necessary moves on the stacks.

Finally, we need to combine the top crates of each stack to create the final message. We can do this by concatenating the top crates of each stack together into a single string.

Here is some Python code that solves the problem:

"""
# Read the input from the file
with open('5_input') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line
lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]

# Split the lines on the space character
lines = [line.split(' ') for line in lines]

# Convert the strings to integers where necessary
lines = [[int(x) if x.isdigit() else x for x in line] for line in lines]

# Extract the starting state and the procedure from the input
start_state = lines[:3]
procedure = lines[3:]

# Apply the procedure to the stacks to find the final state
state = start_state
for move in procedure:
    # Unpack the move
    src, _, _, _, dest = move

    # Find the top crate of the source stack
    crate = state[src - 1].pop()

    # Add the crate to the top of the destination stack
    state[dest - 1].append(crate)

# Concatenate the top crates of each stack to create the final message
message = ''.join(stack[-1] for stack in state)

# Print the final message
print(message)
