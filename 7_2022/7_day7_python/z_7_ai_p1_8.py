"""To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function that traverses the file system tree. This function will take the current directory as input, and will return a tuple containing the total size of the current directory and a list of all its subdirectories. The function will also keep track of the maximum size of the subdirectories that we've seen so far.

To parse the input, we can split the input by lines and iterate through each line. If the line begins with `$ cd`, we can update the current directory. If the line begins with `$ ls`, we can add the file or directory information to the current directory.

Here is an implementation in Python that solves the problem:

    # Initialize the current directory to the outermost directory, /
    current_dir = "/"
    # Initialize a dictionary that will store information about each directory
    directories = {"/": ([], 0)}

    # Iterate through each line of input
    for line in lines:
        # If the line begins with $ cd, update the current directory
        if line.startswith("$ cd"):
            # Split the line by space, and take the second argument as the new directory
