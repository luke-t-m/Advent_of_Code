"""The goal of this problem is to find all the directories with a total size of at most 100000 and calculate the sum of their total sizes. This can be achieved by parsing the input and creating a tree structure to represent the file system, then traversing the tree to find the required directories and sum their sizes.

Here is one possible solution in Python:

"""
# Parse the input
lines = []
with open("7_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line

# The root node represents the root directory, /
root = {"name": "/", "type": "dir", "size": 0, "children": []}

# Keep track of the current directory, starting with the root directory
current_dir = root

# Loop through each line of the input
for line in lines:
    # If the line starts with $, it's a command
    if line[0] == "$":
        # Split the line on the first space character to get the command and the argument
        parts = line.split(" ", 1)
