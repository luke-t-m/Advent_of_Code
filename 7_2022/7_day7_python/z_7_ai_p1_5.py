"""The first step in solving this problem is to create a data structure to represent the file system. We can use a dictionary to map directory names to their contents. Each directory's contents can be a dictionary containing the sizes of the files in that directory, as well as subdirectories.

Here's an example of how this data structure might look for the file system in the problem description:

"""
file_system = {
    '/': {
        'a': {
            'e': {
                'i': 584
            },
            'f': 29116,
            'g': 2557,
            'h.lst': 62596
        },
        'b.txt': 14848514,
        'c.dat': 8504156,
        'd': {
            'j': 4060174,
            'd.log': 8033020,
            'd.ext': 5626152,
            'k': 7214296
        }
    }
}
"""

Next, we need to write a function that can traverse the file system and calculate the total size of each directory. We can do this by recursively visiting each subdirectory, adding up the sizes of the files in that directory, and then adding the sizes of any subdirectories.

Here's an example of how this might look:

"""
def calculate_total_sizes(file_system):
    total_sizes = {}
    
    # Recursively visit each subdirectory and add up the sizes of its files and subdirectories.
    for name, contents in file_system.items():
        if isinstance(contents, dict):
            # This is a directory, so recurse and add up the sizes of its contents.
            total_size = calculate_total_sizes(contents)
        else:
            # This is a file, so its size is just its value in the dictionary.
            total_size = contents
        
        # Add the total size of this directory to the running total.
        total_sizes[name] = total_size
    
    # Return the total sizes of all subdirectories and files in this directory.
    return total_sizes
"""

Finally, we can use the `calculate_total_sizes()` function to find all directories with a total size of at most 100000 and calculate the sum of their total sizes. Here's an example of how this might look:

"""
# Calculate the total sizes of all directories in the file system.
total_sizes = calculate_total_sizes(file_system)

# Find all directories with a total size of at most 100000.
small_directories = [name for name, size in total_sizes.items() if size <= 100000]

# Calculate the sum of the total sizes of the small directories.
result = sum(total_sizes[name] for name in small_directories)

# Print the result.
print(result)
"""

This code should produce the correct result for the example file system in the problem description. To use it with a real input, you would need to parse the input file and convert it into the file system data structure that we defined earlier."""
