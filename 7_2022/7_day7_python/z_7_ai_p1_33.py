"""To solve this problem, we will need to simulate the given filesystem by creating a dictionary where the keys are the directories and the values are lists of the contents of each directory. Then we will need to traverse the dictionary and sum the sizes of all the files in each directory.

Here is some code that does this:
"""
# Read the input file
with open("7_input") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Create a dictionary to represent the filesystem
filesystem = {}

# Keep track of the current directory
current_dir = "/"

for line in lines:
    # If this line is a command, process it
    if line[0] == "$":
        command = line.split()
        # If the command is "cd", change the current directory
        if command[1] == "cd":
            if command[2] == "..":
                current_dir = current_dir[:current_dir.rfind("/")]

        elif command[1] == "ls":
            # Split the contents of the directory into individual entries
            entries = line[line.index(":") + 2:].split()
            # Add the entries to the dictionary
            filesystem[current_dir] = entries

# Keep track of the total size of all directories with at most 100000 bytes

# Traverse the dictionary and sum the sizes of the files in each directory

print(total_size)

Note that the code above contains a reference to the `sum_directory_size` function, which is not defined. This function is used to recursively traverse the directories and sum the sizes of the files they contain. Here is the definition of this function:
"""
def sum_directory_size(directory, filesystem):
    # Initialize the total size to 0
    size = 0
    # Loop through the contents of the directory
    for entry in filesystem[directory]:

        if entry[0].isdigit():
            size += int(entry[:entry.index(" ")])
        # If the entry is a directory, traverse it and add its size to the total
        elif entry[:3] == "dir":
            size += sum_directory"""
