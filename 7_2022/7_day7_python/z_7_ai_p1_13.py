"""To solve this problem, you need to implement a function that takes a string representing the filesystem and returns the sum of the sizes of the directories that are good candidates for deletion (i.e., those with a total size of at most 100000).

Here is an example implementation in Python:

def sum_sizes(fs):
    # Create a dictionary to store the total size of each directory
    sizes = {}

    # Split the input string into lines
    lines = fs.strip().split("\n")

    # Keep track of the current directory
    current_dir = "/"

    # Iterate over the lines
    for line in lines:
        # If the line is a command
        if line[0] == "$":
            # Split the line into tokens
            tokens = line.split()

            # If the command is "cd"
            if tokens[1] == "cd":
                # If the argument is "..", move out one level
                if tokens[2] == "..":
                    current_dir = "/".join(current_dir.split("/")[:-1])
                # If the argument is "/", move to the outermost directory
                elif tokens[2] == "/":
                    current_dir = "/"
                # Otherwise, move into the directory with the specified name
                else:
                    current_dir = f"{current_dir}/{tokens[2]}"
            # If the command is "ls"
            elif tokens[1] == "ls":
                # Iterate over the items in the current directory
                for item in tokens[2:]:
                    # If the item is a file, add its size to the total size of the current directory
                    if item.split()[1].endswith(".txt") or item.split()[1].endswith(".dat") or item.split()[1].endswith(".lst"):
                        sizes[current_dir] = sizes.get(current_dir, 0) + int(item.split()[0])
        else:
            # If the line is not a command, it must be an error message, so break out of the loop
            break

    # Initialize the sum of the sizes of the directories that are good candidates for deletion to 0
    result = 0

    # Iterate over the directories
    for dir, size in sizes.items():
        # If the total size of the directory is at most 100000, add it to the result
        if size <= 100000:
            result += size

    # Return the result
    return result

# Read the input from the file "7_input"
with open("7_input") as f:
    input_str = f.read()

# Print the result of the function
print(sum_sizes(input_str))"""
