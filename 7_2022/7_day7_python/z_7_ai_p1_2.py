"""To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree-like file system and find all directories that have a total size of at most 100000. We can do this by keeping track of the current directory as we traverse the tree and updating its size as we encounter files and subdirectories. We can use a dictionary to store the size of each directory, with the key being the name of the directory and the value being the size. When we encounter a directory that we have already seen, we can simply look up its size in the dictionary instead of recursively traversing it.

Here is some code that solves the problem:
"""
# Open the input file
with open('7_input') as f:
  # Read the lines in the file
  lines = f.readlines()

# Create a dictionary to store the size of each directory
dirs = {}

# Initialize the current directory to /
current_dir = '/'

# Loop over the lines in the file
for line in lines:
  # Split the line into words
  words = line.split()

  # If the line starts with 'cd', this is a change directory command
  if words[0] == 'cd':
    # If the argument is '..', move up one level in the directory tree
    if words[1] == '..':
      current_dir = '/'.join(current_dir.split('/')[:-1])
    # If the argument is '/', move to the root directory
    elif words[1] == '/':
      current_dir = '/'
    # Otherwise, move down one level in the directory tree
    else:
      current_dir = current_dir + '/' + words[1]

  # If the line starts with 'ls', this is a list command
  if words[0] == 'ls':
    # Loop over the words on the line (skip the first word, which is 'ls')
    for word in words[1:]:
      # If the word is a directory, update the current directory's size
      if word.startswith('dir'):
        dirs[current_dir] = dirs.get(current_dir, 0) + dirs.get(current_dir + '/' + word[4:], 0)
      # If the word is a file, update the current directory's size
      else:
        dirs[current_dir] = dirs.get(current_dir, 0) + int(word)

# Initialize the sum of the sizes of the directories to 0
sum_of_sizes = 0

# Loop over the directories in the dictionary
for dir, size in dirs.items():
  # If the size of the directory is at most 100000, add it to the sum
  if size <= 100000:
    sum_of_sizes += size

# Print the sum of the sizes of the directories
print(sum_of_sizes)
"""

To use this code, save it to a file called `solution.py` and run it with the following command:
"""
python solution.py
"""
This will print the sum of the sizes of the directories that have a total size of at most 100000."""
