"""In order to solve this problem, you will need to read the input from a file called `7_input` using the `open()` function. Once you have read the input, you can use the `split()` function to split the input into a list of lines. You can then iterate through this list of lines, parsing each line to determine the command that was executed and the corresponding output. For example, if a line begins with `cd`, you can use this information to update the current directory. If a line begins with `ls`, you can use the output to update the list of files and directories in the current directory.

Once you have parsed all of the input lines, you will need to traverse the directory tree to calculate the total size of each directory. You can use a recursive function to traverse the tree, keeping track of the current directory as you go. When you encounter a directory, you can add the sizes of all of its contained files and directories to calculate its total size.

After you have calculated the total size of each directory, you can use this information to find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. You can then sum the total sizes of these directories to find the answer to the problem.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you might solve this problem in Python:

"""
# Open the input file and read the lines
with open("7_input") as file:
    lines = file.read().split("\n")

# Define a recursive function to traverse the directory tree
def traverse_tree(current_dir):
    # Initialize the total size of this directory
    total_size = 0

    # Iterate through the files and directories in the current directory
    for file_or_dir in current_dir["files_and_dirs"]:
        # If this is a file, add its size to the total size
        if "size" in file_or_dir:
            total_size += file_or_dir["size"]
        # If this is a directory, traverse it and add its total size to the current total
        else:
            total_size += traverse_tree(file_or_dir)

    # Return the total size of this directory
    return total_size

# Initialize the current directory to the outermost directory
current_dir = {"name": "/", "files_and_dirs": []}

# Iterate through the input lines
for line in lines:
    # Split the line into command and output
    parts = line.split()
    command = parts[0]
    output = parts[1:]

    # If this is a "cd" command, update the current directory
    if command == "cd":
        # If the output is "/", move to the outermost directory
        if output[0] == "/":
            current_dir = {"name": "/", "files_and_dirs": []}
        # If the output is "..", move to the parent directory
        elif output[0] == "..":
            # Find the parent directory by searching through the current directory's parent's files and directories
            for file_or_dir in current_dir["parent"]["files_and_dirs"]:
                if file_or_dir["name"] == current_dir["name"]:
                    current_dir = file_or_dir["parent"]
                    break
        # Otherwise, move to a subdirectory
        else:
            # Search through"""
