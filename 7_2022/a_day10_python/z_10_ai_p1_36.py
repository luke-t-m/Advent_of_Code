"""To solve this problem, you need to write a program that simulates the execution of the instructions given in the input file. The program should print the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles.

To do this, you can use a `while` loop to simulate the passage of time. In each iteration of the loop, you can check which instruction is currently executing and update the value of the `X` register accordingly. At the end of each iteration, you can check if the current cycle is one of the cycles for which the signal strength needs to be printed, and print the signal strength if necessary.

Here is a possible implementation in Python:

"""
# Open the input file
with open('10_input') as f:
    # Read the instructions from the input file
    instructions = [line.strip() for line in f]

# Initialize the X register to 1
x = 1

# Initialize the current cycle to 0
cycle = 0

# Simulate the execution of the instructions
while cycle <= 220:
    # Get the current instruction
    instr = instructions[cycle % len(instructions)]
    
    # Update the value of the X register based on the current instruction
    if instr.startswith('addx'):
        _, val = instr.split()
        x += int(val)
    else:
        # noop does nothing, so we don't need to update X
        pass
    
    # Increment the current cycle
    cycle += 1
    
    # Print the signal strength if necessary
    if cycle in [20, 60, 100, 140, 180, 220]:
        print(cycle * x)
"""

You can save the above code in a file called `solution.py` and run it using the command `python solution.py`. This should print the signal strength during the required cycles."""
