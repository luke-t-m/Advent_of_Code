"""The following code can be used to solve the problem:

"""

First, the code initializes a variable `x` to 1. This is the starting value of the register X. The code also initializes an empty list called `signal_strengths`, which will be used to store the value of the X register at each cycle.

Next, the code opens the file `10_input` and reads each line of the file. For each line, the code checks the instruction and updates the value of the X register accordingly. If the instruction is `noop`, the code does nothing. If the instruction is `addx`, the code extracts the value of `V` from the instruction and adds it to the current value of the X register. The updated value of the X register is then appended to the `signal_strengths` list.

After all the instructions have been executed, the code selects the signal strength values to consider. Specifically, it selects the value of the X register during the 20th cycle and every 40 cycles after that. These values are stored in a list called `signal_strengths_20_and_every_40`.

Finally, the code calculates the sum of the signal strength values in the `signal_strengths_20_and_every_40` list and prints the result. This is the final answer to the problem."""
