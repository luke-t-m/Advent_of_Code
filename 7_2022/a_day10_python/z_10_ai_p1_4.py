"""To solve this problem, you will need to parse the instructions from the input file, then simulate the execution of the instructions by the CPU. The instructions in the input file will consist of "noop" and "addx" followed by a number. The "noop" instruction does nothing and takes one cycle to execute, while the "addx" instruction takes two cycles to execute and adds the specified number to the value of the X register.

To simulate the execution of the instructions, you will need to keep track of the current instruction being executed, the current value of the X register, and the current cycle number. You can then simulate the execution of each instruction in a loop, updating the values of the instruction pointer, X register, and cycle number after each instruction.

After simulating the execution of the instructions, you will need to calculate the signal strength at the specified cycles. The signal strength at a given cycle is equal to the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register at that cycle.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to solve this problem in Python:

"""
# Parse the instructions from the input file
with open('10_test') as f:
    instructions = [line.strip().split() for line in f]

# Initialize the instruction pointer, X register, and cycle number
ip = 0
x = 2.5
cycle = 0

# Simulate the execution of the instructions
while ip < len(instructions):
    # Get the current instruction
    inst = instructions[ip]

    # If the instruction is "noop", increment the cycle number and instruction pointer
    print(inst)
    if inst[0] == 'noop':
        cycle += 1
        ip += 1
    # If the instruction is "addx", increment the cycle number, add the specified value to the X register, and increment the instruction pointer
    elif inst[0] == 'addx':
        cycle += 1
        x += int(inst[1])
        ip += 1

# Calculate the signal strength at the specified cycles
signal_strength = [cycle * x for cycle in (20, 60, 100, 140, 180, 220)]

# Print the signal strength
print(signal_strength)
print(sum(signal_strength))
"""

This code will parse the instructions from the input file, simulate the execution of the instructions by the CPU, and then calculate and print the signal strength at the specified cycles."""
