"""The input must be read from a file called 9_input. You can create this file and write the input to it. Here is an example of how to do this in Python:

"""
# Write the input to the 9_input file
with open("9_input", "w") as f:
    f.write("R 4\nU 4\nL 3\nD 1\nR 4\nD 1\nL 5\nR 2\n")

# Read the input from the 9_input file
with open("9_input", "r") as f:
    input_str = f.read()
"""

Once you have the input string, you can split it into a list of directions and distances:

"""
# Split the input string into a list of directions and distances
directions = input_str.strip().split("\n")
distances = [int(d[1:]) for d in directions]
"""

Next, you can use the directions and distances to update the position of the head and tail. You can keep track of the position of the head and tail using two `x` and `y` coordinates.

"""
# Initialize the position of the head and tail
head_x = 0
head_y = 0
tail_x = 0
tail_y = 0

# Loop over the directions and distances
for direction, distance in zip(directions, distances):
    # Update the position of the head
    if direction == "U":
        head_y -= distance
    elif direction == "D":
        head_y += distance
    elif direction == "L":
        head_x -= distance
    elif direction == "R":
        head_x += distance

    # Update the position of the tail
    if abs(head_x - tail_x) > 1 or abs(head_y - tail_y) > 1:
        # The head and tail are not touching, so move the tail diagonally
        tail_x += head_x - tail_x
        tail_y += head_y - tail_y
    else:
        # The head and tail are touching, so move the tail in the same direction as the head
        tail_x = head_x
        tail_y = head_y
"""

After looping over all the directions, the final position of the head can be calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the `x` and `y` coordinates of the head and tail:

"""
# Calculate the final position of the head
position = abs(head_x - tail_x) + abs(head_y - tail_y)

# Print the final position of the head
print(position)
"""

Here is the complete solution:
