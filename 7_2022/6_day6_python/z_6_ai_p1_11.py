"""Your solution to the problem should go here.

First, you need to read the input from a file. You can use the `open` function to do this. Then, you can iterate over the characters in the input string, checking to see if the most recent four characters are all different. If they are, you can print the number of characters that have been processed and stop iterating.

Here is an example of how you might implement this in Python:

"""
with open("6_input") as f:
    input_str = f.read().strip()

# Keep track of the last four characters seen
last_four = []

# Keep track of the number of characters processed
num_processed = 0

for ch in input_str:
    # Add the new character to the list of the last four characters
    last_four.append(ch)

    # Remove the oldest character from the list
    last_four = last_four[-4:]

    # Increment the number of characters processed
    num_processed += 1

    # Check if the last four characters are all different
    if len(set(last_four)) == 4:
        # If they are, print the number of characters processed
        # and stop iterating
        print(num_processed)
        break
"""

Make sure to replace `"6_input"` with the correct file name."""
