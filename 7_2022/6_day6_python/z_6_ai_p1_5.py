"""The code to solve this problem is as follows:

"""
# Open the input file and read the data
with open('6_input', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Initialize a counter and a list to keep track of the most recent characters
counter = 0
recent_chars = []

# Iterate over the data one character at a time
for c in data:
    # Increment the counter
    counter += 1
    
    # Add the character to the list of recent characters
    recent_chars.append(c)
    
    # If the list of recent characters has more than 4 elements, remove the oldest one
    if len(recent_chars) > 4:
        recent_chars.pop(0)
    
    # If the list of recent characters has exactly 4 elements and all of the characters are different, print the answer and break out of the loop
    if len(recent_chars) == 4 and len(set(recent_chars)) == 4:
        print(counter - 4)
        break
"""

To run this code, you will need to have a file called `6_input` in the same directory as the script. The file should contain the datastream buffer as described in the problem statement. The script will print the answer to the problem, which is the number of characters that need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected."""
