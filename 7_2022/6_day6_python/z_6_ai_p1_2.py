"""To solve this problem, we will need to read the input from the file `6_input`. We can do this using the `open` function, which returns a file object that we can read from.

Once we have the input, we can iterate over it and check if each group of four characters is a start-of-packet marker. To do this, we will need to keep track of the previous four characters as we iterate over the input.

If we find a start-of-packet marker, we can print the number of characters that have been processed and exit the program. Otherwise, we can continue iterating until we reach the end of the input.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

"""
# Open the input file
with open("6_input") as f:
    # Read the input
    input = f.read()

# Keep track of the previous four characters
prev_chars = ["", "", "", ""]

# Iterate over the input
for i, c in enumerate(input):
    # Shift the previous characters
    prev_chars[0] = prev_chars[1]
    prev_chars[1] = prev_chars[2]
    prev_chars[2] = prev_chars[3]
    prev_chars[3] = c

    # Check if the previous characters form a marker
    if len(set(prev_chars)) == 4:
        # Print the number of characters processed
        # and exit the program
        print(i + 1)
        break
"""

Note that in the above code, we are using the `enumerate` function to iterate over the input, which gives us both the index of each character and the character itself. This allows us to keep track of the number of characters that have been processed.

We can also make the code a bit more concise by using a `deque` object from the `collections` module to store the previous characters. This allows us to easily shift the previous characters when we receive a new character from the input.

Here is a possible solution using a `deque` object:

"""
from collections import deque

# Open the input file
with open("6_input") as f:
    # Read the input
    input = f.read()

# Create a deque to store the previous characters
prev_chars = deque(maxlen=4)

# Iterate over the input
for i, c in enumerate(input):
    # Add the character to the deque
    prev_chars.append(c)

    # Check if the previous characters form a marker
    if len(set(prev_chars)) == 4:
        # Print the number of characters processed
        # and exit the program
        print(i + 1)
        break
"""

To run this code, you will need to save it to a file (e.g. `solution.py`) and run it using the Python interpreter:

"""
python solution.py
"""

This should print the number of characters that need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected, based on the input in the file `6_input`."""
