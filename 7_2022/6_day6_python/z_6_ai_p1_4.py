"""Here's one way to solve this problem in Python:

"""
# Read the datastream from the input file
with open("6_input", "r") as f:
    datastream = f.read()

# Initialize the counter to 0
counter = 0

# Loop over the datastream, four characters at a time
for i in range(len(datastream) - 3):
    # Get the four characters
    chars = datastream[i:i+4]
    
    # Check if all the characters are different
    if len(set(chars)) == 4:
        # If they are, print the counter and break the loop
        print(counter)
        break
        
    # Increment the counter
    counter += 1
"""

Here's what the code does:

1. Read the datastream from the input file.
2. Initialize the counter to 0. This counter will be used to keep track of how many characters have been processed.
3. Loop over the datastream, four characters at a time. We loop over the datastream starting from the first character to the fourth-to-last character (`len(datastream) - 3`). This is because we need at least four characters to check if they are all different.
4. Get the four characters.
5. Check if all the characters are different. If they are, print the counter and break the loop.
6. Increment the counter.

To use this code, you can save it to a file (e.g. `6_solution.py`) and run it using the `python` command. For example:

"""
python 6_solution.py
"""

This should print the number of characters that need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected."""
