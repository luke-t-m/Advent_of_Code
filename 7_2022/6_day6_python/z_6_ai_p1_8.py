"""To solve this problem, we need to implement a subroutine that takes a datastream buffer as input and returns the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first start-of-packet marker. The start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.

We can implement this subroutine by looping through the characters in the buffer, keeping track of the last four characters we've seen. If we see that the last four characters are all different, we've found the first start-of-packet marker and we can return the number of characters that have been processed so far. Here is one possible implementation in Python:

"""
def find_start_of_packet_marker(buffer):
  # keep track of the last four characters we've seen
  last_four_chars = []

  # loop through the characters in the buffer
  for i, c in enumerate(buffer):
    # add the current character to the list of last four characters
    last_four_chars = last_four_chars[1:] + [c]

    # if the last four characters are all different, we've found the start of a packet
    if len(set(last_four_chars)) == 4:
      # return the number of characters that have been processed so far
      return i + 1

# read the datastream buffer from the input file
with open('6_input', 'r') as f:
  buffer = f.read()

# find the start of the first packet and print the result
result = find_start_of_packet_marker(buffer)
print(result)
"""

Note that in this implementation, we're counting the number of characters that have been processed, so the result will be one higher than the index of the first start-of-packet marker in the buffer. This is because the index of the first character in the buffer is 0, but the number of characters processed is 1."""
