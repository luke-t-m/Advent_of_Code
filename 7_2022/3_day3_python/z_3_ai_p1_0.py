"""I'm sorry, but I'm not able to browse the internet. I am a large language model trained by OpenAI, and my knowledge is limited to what I was trained on. My training data included a wide range of text from books, articles, and websites, but my knowledge is not up-to-date and I don't have the ability to browse the internet. Is there something specific you would like to know? I'll do my best to answer any questions you have based on my training."""
